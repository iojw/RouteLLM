Israeli culture views higher education as the key to higher mobility and socioeconomic status in Israeli society. The emphasis of education within Israeli society goes to the gulf within the Jewish diaspora from the Renaissance and Enlightenment Movement all the way to the roots of Zionism in the 1880s. Jewish communities in the Levant were the first to introduce compulsory education for which the organized community, not less than the parents, was responsible for the education of the next generation of Jews. With contemporary Jewish culture's strong emphasis, promotion of scholarship and learning and the strong propensity to promote cultivation of intellectual pursuits as well as the nations high university educational attainment rate exemplifies how highly Israeli society values higher education. The Israeli education system has been praised for various reasons, including its high quality and its major role in spurring Israel's economic development and technological boom. Many international business leaders and organizations such as Microsoft founder Bill Gates have praised Israel for its high quality of education in helping spur Israel's economic development. In 2012, the country ranked second among OECD countries (tied with Japan and after Canada) for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 46 percent compared with the OECD average of 32 percent.

Sean Poulter, Consumer Affairs Editor. PUBLISHED:. 13:50 EST, 26 November 2013. |. UPDATED:. 19:38 EST, 26 November 2013. A strain of the food-poisoning bug MRSA has been found in turkeys being prepared for Christmas on a farm in East Anglia. In a move that will alarm consumers, however, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs has decided to keep the name of the farm and the retailers it supplies a secret. It said last night there was no need to stop the sale of the turkeys as the risk to consumers was \u2018very low\u2019 if the meat was handled carefully and cooked thoroughly. Turkeys on a farm in East Anglia have tested positive for food poisoning bug MRSA but the Government's food and farming department has refused to say which on or who they supply (file picture) Defra said its Animal Health and. Veterinary Laboratories Agency had found Livestock-Associated. Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (LA-MRSA) in poultry during a. routine inspection on the farm in East Anglia. This is not the same form of the bacteria that cause illness in people, and usually clears within 24 hours. Officials. said the most likely reaction if it affected humans would be a skin. rash, similar to eczema, rather than the stomach problems associated. with food-poisoning bugs. Defra said that once the turkeys had been slaughtered and sold, the farm owner would disinfect barns. However,. the fact that the department has decided to keep details of the case. secret \u2013 protecting the farming and food industry at the expense of. providing information to consumers \u2013 will raise questions about its. priorities. The Government. has been criticised for its handling of the scandal of horsemeat being. sold in beef products earlier this year. So far, not a single meat. producer, supermarket or abattoir has been prosecuted. Government department Defra has decided there is no need to stop the sale of the birds which are destined for Christmas lunches across England. Steve. Wearne, of the Food Standards Agency, said: \u2018Any risk of contracting. MRSA through meat from animals with these bacteria is very low when. usual good hygiene and thorough cooking practices are observed. \u2018All poultry should be handled hygienically and cooked thoroughly to destroy any bacteria that may be present.\u2019 However,. hundreds of thousands of people in the UK are believed to fall ill. every year because they do not handle and cook poultry with the. necessary care. Professor. Angela Kearns, head of the Staphylococcus Reference Unit at Public. Health England, said: \u2018There are many different strains of MRSA that. cause illness in people, but this is not one of the strains that we are. overly concerned about. Defra has decided against naming the farm or its suppliers in a move sure to anger consumers. \u2018This. strain is relatively widespread in livestock in Europe, including. countries from which meat is regularly sourced by the UK. There are no. known cases of people contracting MRSA from eating meat.\u2019 Professor.

Article: The World Health Organization (WHO) planned to study the relationship between the eating habits of the people and the disease. Two doctors were chosen to make the study. They flew to Africa south of the Sahara and during the next two months visited ten countries. They found that serious diseases of poor eating, often mistaken for other diseases, existed in all parts of Africa. The diseases were similar and could therefore all be named kwashiorkor. The diseased children are usually from one to four years old. As the illness progresses, the child's stomach becomes swollen by liquid collecting in the body. The skin changes color and may break out in open sores . The hair changes color and starts to fall out. The patient loses all interest in his surroundings and even in food, and becomes so weak that he wants to lie down all the time. Stomach liquids are no longer produced. The doctors reasoned that kwashiorkor was found in the young children of this age in many parts of Africa because of lack of milk or meat. Their mothers, after stopping their breastfeeding, gave them foods full of starches instead of greatly needed proteins. They found that the addition of milk to the food of the children suffering from kwashiorkor saved many lives. The unbelievable thing about kwashiorkor is that the very existence of the disease--which has been killing thousands of children for centuries--was not even recognized in Latin America as recently as ten years ago. The deaths of those children were mistakenly listed as due to other diseases. It was the WHO's work in Africa that led to the discovery of the problem in Central America.

His father was illiterate and encouraged his children to work from an early age to help the family survive, rather than attend school. By the age of 6, Jara was already working on the land. His father could not support the family on his earnings as a peasant at the Ruiz-Tagle estate, nor was he able to find stable work.\nContext: After joining the choir at the University of Chile in Santiago, Jara was convinced by a choir-mate to pursue a career in theater. He subsequently joined the university's theater program and earned a scholarship for talent. He appeared in several of the university's plays, gravitating toward those with social themes, such as Russian playwright Maxim Gorky's The Lower Depths, a depiction of the hardships of lower-class life.  In 1957, he met Violeta Parra, a singer who had steered folk music in Chile away from the rote reproduction of rural materials toward modern song composition rooted in traditional forms, and who had established musical community centers called penas to incorporate folk music into the everyday life of modern Chileans. Jara absorbed these lessons and began singing with a group called Cuncumen, with whom he continued his explorations of Chile's traditional music. He was deeply influenced by the folk music of Chile and other Latin American countries, and by artists such as Parra, Atahualpa Yupanqui, and the poet Pablo Neruda.  In the 1960s, Jara started specializing in folk music and sang at Santiago's La Pena de Los Parra, owned by Angel Parra. Through these activities, he became involved in the Nueva Cancion movement of Latin American folk music. He released his first album, Canto a lo humano, in 1966, and by 1970, he had left his theater work in favor of a career in music. His songs were inspired by a combination of traditional folk music and left-wing political activism. From this period, some of his best-known songs are \"Plegaria a un Labrador\" (\"Prayer to a Worker\") and \"Te Recuerdo Amanda\" (\"I Remember You Amanda\").\nQuestion: What was her first theater performance?\n\nAnswer:", "Q: In this task, you are given a Reddit post as a text.

Context: Have you ever sat around and thought about how you\u2019d create your dream kitchen if you had the chance? Well, we are on the verge of a move (whenever the house sells, we\u2019ll move), and I keep thinking that I need to sit down and write a list of our \u201cwould likes\u201d and our \u201cmust haves.\u201d That way, when we are house hunting, we\u2019ll already know what we\u2019re looking for. For a chance to win an Un Amore custom-designed KitchenAid Stand Mixer from PartSelect, I have been thinking about the top three \u201cwould likes\u201d for our new kitchen and decided to check out what KitchenAid has to offer! I discovered three appliances that would change our reality kitchen into a dream kitchen. We have two young boys that will change into tweens and teens before we know it. Big Brother has always been a good eater, open to trying just about anything we put in front of him. However, discovering that he actually does have some control over what he does, he\u2019s lately turned up his nose on occasion. Little Brother is exactly like me when I was young. He turns his nose up at just about anything. Although he did just spend a week with his grandparents and decided he would eat and make up for lost meals\u2026and make me out to be a liar! Anyway, I keep reminding myself as I find myself challenged at mealtimes, that soon enough, they\u2019ll be eating us out of house and home. So, one of the larger dream kitchen appliances I\u2019d like in our home would be a double oven! I just think it\u2019d come in really handy when trying to keep up with their metabolism down the road! When you\u2019re preparing a lot of food, you\u2019re typically buying a lot of products, and the garbage and recycling bins fill up faster than ever as well. The second dream kitchen appliance I wouldn\u2019t mind having would be the KitchenAid Trash Compactor, reducing our use of garbage bags and trips to the outside dumpster. Plus, I think I\u2019d like not having to smell the garbage all the time! Question: Why did the narrator want a double oven? Answer:\nA:", "Article:\n\nRecruiters for the best jobs available for recent grads are brutally harsh about where you went to school, even if you went to MIT or Cornell, according to a new research study done by an assistant professor at Northwestern. \n  \n The report says elite law firms, investment banks, and consultancy firms are only looking for recruits from the \"top 5,\" Harvard, Yale, Princeton, Stanford, and Wharton, according to her research. \n  \n And once you've got one of those schools on your resume, you have to prove you aren't \"boring,\" a \"tool,\" or a \"bookworm,\" by climbing a mountain or being a nationally-ranked athlete. \n  \n Some of the study's findings you've heard before. For example, when the author of the report asked a manager from a top investment bank what happens to the resume of someone who went to Rutgers. They said, \u201cI\u2019m just being really honest, it pretty much goes into a black hole.\u201d \n  \n Rutgers, ok. But not even MIT makes the cut! \n  \n A top consultant told her: \n  \n You will find it when you go to like career fairs or something and you know someone will show up and say, you know, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t go to HBS [Harvard Business School] but, you know, I am an engineer at M.I.T. and I heard about this fair and I wanted to come meet you in New York.\u201d God bless him for the effort but, you know, it\u2019s just not going to work. \n  \n Or Columbia! \n  \n From The Chronicle: \n  \n Columbia might be considered elite by some investment banks, but others describe it as \u201dsecond-tier\u201d or \u201cjust okay.\u201d \n  \n As crazy as it sounds, the incredible new research study confirms what we've been saying all along in our annual ranking of colleges. The main thing that matters is the pedigree (brand name) of the school you went to. \n  \n If you didn't go to one of the \"top 5\" listed above, the recruiters you'll probably need a connection, or to be really strong in the second category of things they're looking for, extracurriculars. \n  \n Recruiters want to make sure you aren't \u201cboring,\u201d a \u201ctool,\u201d or a \u201dbookworm\" (their words) so they look for top athletes, and people who have summited an impressive peak, or traveled with a world-renowned orchestra, or built houses in Costa Rica. \n  \n But weirdly, being an excellent sportsman will only help you if it's the \"right\" sport. Crew is great; ping pong is not. \n  \n Anyone else getting that the message from all this is, start your own company? \n  \n Click here to see our guide to the best colleges in America > ||||| If you want to get a job at the very best law firm, investment bank, or consultancy, here\u2019s what you do: \n  \n 1. Go to Harvard, Yale, Princeton, or (maybe) Stanford. If you\u2019re a business student, attending the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania will work, too, but don\u2019t show up with a diploma from Dartmouth or MIT. No one cares about those places. \n  \n 2. Don\u2019t work your rear off for a 4.0. Better to graduate with 3.7 and a bunch of really awesome extracurriculars. And by \u201creally awesome\u201d I mean literally climbing Everest or winning an Olympic medal. Playing intramurals doesn\u2019t cut it. \n  \n That\u2019s the upshot of an enlightening/depressing study about the ridiculously narrow-minded people who make hiring decisions at the aforementioned elite companies. The author of this study\u2014Lauren Rivera, an assistant professor of management and organizations at Northwestern University\u2014gained inside access to the hiring process at one such (unnamed) business, and picked the brains of recruiters at other firms. \n  \n The portrait that emerges is of a culture that\u2019s insanely obsessed with pedigree. These firms pour resources into recruiting students from \u201ctarget schools\u201d (i.e., Harvard, Yale, Princeton) and then more or less ignore everybody else. Here\u2019s a manager from a top investment bank describing what happens to the resume of someone who went to, say, Rutgers: \u201cI\u2019m just being really honest, it pretty much goes into a black hole.\u201d \n  \n What\u2019s surprising isn\u2019t that students from elite universities have a leg up; it\u2019s that students from other colleges don\u2019t have a chance, even if those colleges are what the rest of us might consider elite. Here\u2019s what a top consultant had to say about M.I.T.: \n  \n You will find it when you go to like career fairs or something and you know someone will show up and say, you know, \u201cHey, I didn\u2019t go to HBS [Harvard Business School] but, you know, I am an engineer at M.I.T. and I heard about this fair and I wanted to come meet you in New York.\u201d God bless him for the effort but, you know, it\u2019s just not going to work. \n  \n There are exceptions, but only if the candidate has some personal connection with the firm. And the list of super-elite schools varies somewhat depending on the field. For instance, Columbia might be considered elite by some investment banks, but others describe it as \u201dsecond-tier\u201d or \u201cjust okay.\u201d \n  \n So going to Harvard is a prerequisite. But you also need to prove, in the words of the recruiters, that you\u2019re not \u201cboring,\u201d a \u201ctool,\u201d or a \u201dbookworm.\u201d This is where your leisure pursuits come in. Among the acceptable extra-curricular activities listed in the paper: traveling with a world-renowned orchestra and building houses in Costa Rica. It\u2019s good to play sports, but they have to be the right ones. Being on the crew team is acceptable; being on the ping-pong team is not. Ideally, you should be a national or Olympic champion. And if you like hiking, you should summit some impressive peak. \n  \n When you read the accounts of recruiters at these firms, you get a sense of why they might choose these metrics. They have multiple stacks of resumes. They meet hundreds of applicants at career fairs. Rather than scrutinizing anyone\u2019s resume it\u2019s easier just to limit the pool to the top three or four universities. Do you really want to pore over the transcript of that kid from the University of Michigan? Wouldn\u2019t it be easier just to call the Harvard grad? In essence, what they\u2019re assuming is that the admissions offices at the super-elite schools have already picked the best of the best. Why second guess them? \n  \n You also can\u2019t read this study without getting the feeling that the game is rigged. That obtaining a name-brand diploma matters more than actually learning something. That the gatekeepers at our nation\u2019s most prestigious firms are pathetically shallow, outrageously parochial, and insufferably snobbish. The message is this: \n  \n It\u2019s not what you did in college. It\u2019s where you got in. \n  \n (Here\u2019s the abstract for the paper.

First, understand why older people fall There are many reasons that aging adults fall. Most older people will be falling due to their own unique combination of reasons. So how, exactly, should YOU go about reducing fall risk? Now, you can \u2014 and should \u2014 try to implement the general tips that are often listed in most fall prevention resources: exercise, medication review with the doctor, vision checks, and home safety reviews. But if you really want to help an older loved one avoid falls, I recommend you learn to better understand why he or she, in particular, might fall. Question: After the elderly are given personalized fall prevention programs how do they probably feel about falls?

The film is set in the early 1980s in small town Virginia. Aurelie is the new girl in town, having recently relocated from Washington D.C. with her parents Jim (a former steward for Air Force One) and Jeanne. Jim is attending college on a scholarship to become a physician while Jeanne, now the breadwinner, works at the local chicken shack. Aurelie asks her parents if she can have a permanent to fit in with the \"Farrah Fawcett\" types in town. Her parents finally relent and take her to a local beauty school to get her hair processed at a discount. The result is disastrous, making Aurelie look more like orphan Annie than Farrah. She starts school and is immediately teased by everyone. She tries to befriend the only black girl in school, Lydia, but is rebuffed. Aurelie furthers her unpopularity by overly participating in class and is frequently bullied by a group of popular girls. Aurelie reluctantly takes a karate class in order to defend herself. She sees a sign on another beauty shop in town that advertises permanent fixes for $60 and resolves to make the money. Eventually the school holds a poetry reading contest, with a top prize of $75. Aurelie signs up herself and Lydia. Lydia initially does not want to participate. During the poetry contest she panics and recites the lyrics to \"Feeling Good\" instead of her assigned poem. Meanwhile, Aurelie is confronted by the popular girls. She uses her karate training to defeat the girls and returns to the contest to see that Lydia has been announced the winner. Lydia offers Aurelie the money to fix her hair, and Aurelie declines saying that she no longer cares.\nA:", "Area 51 UFO Myths\nposted: 21 HOURS 58 MINUTES AGO\n\n(April 15) -- Area 51, the top-secret military installation in the Nevada desert, has been a magnet for conspiracy theories and a font of UFO sightings for decades. Now some people who worked at the mysterious base are speaking out.\n\nFor its April issue, the\n\ninterviewed five men who worked at the facility, some of them for decades.\n\nThe men are talking now because in 2007, the CIA declassified information about a key project -- the A-12 Oxcart, a covert spy plane that was developed at Area 51. They have fascinating stories life at the base, including how the military responded to security breaches involving secret projects. But perhaps the most interesting part of the article is their response to the legends that have sprouted up about the installation.\n\nOne of the legends -- that Area 51 is connected to other secret sites by out-of-the-way railroads and underground tunnels -- is based on a nugget of truth. Thornton \"T.D.\" Barnes, 72, who was an engineer at the facility, told the Times that he conducted his work in underground chambers.\n\n\"Three test-cell facilities were connected by railroad, but everything else was underground,\" he said.\n\nAnd what about the slew of UFO sightings around Area 51? The Times attributed them to the Oxcart, which had a disk-like fuselage and flew at speeds of over 2,000 mph. The plane's titanium body was highly reflective, which also may have thrown anyone who caught a glimpse of it.\n\nAir Force Col. Hugh \"Slip\" Slater, 87, was commander of Area 51 in the 1960s, and 2,850 Oxcart test flights were conducted when he was there. \"That's a lot of UFO sightings!\" he told the magazine.\n\nWhen commercial pilots would report a UFO around Area 51, \"they'd be met by FBI agents who'd make them sign nondisclosure forms,\" Slater said.\n\nThe Air Force had an operation called Project Blue Book to log such incidents from all around the country. By the time the Oxcart program was terminated in December 1969, it had received 12,618 reported sightings, 701 of which remained classified as \"unidentified.\"\n\nThe CIA has a searchable database of declassified Oxcart information\n\nThe National Archives has a selection of documents related to the project\n\n2009 AOL LLC.

In the 18th century the differences among human groups became a focus of scientific investigation. But the scientific classification of phenotypic variation was frequently coupled with racist ideas about innate predispositions of different groups, always attributing the most desirable features to the White, European race and arranging the other races along a continuum of progressively undesirable attributes. The 1735 classification of Carl Linnaeus, inventor of zoological taxonomy, divided the human race Homo sapiens into continental varieties of europaeus, asiaticus, americanus, and afer, each associated with a different humour: sanguine, melancholic, choleric, and phlegmatic, respectively.

More than 16,000 people died in the disaster and more than 470,000 were removed from their homes, says the Japanese Red Cross Society. Over 2,500 people are still missing and predicted dead. After pressure from survivors, the Japanese Coast Guard began underwater searches for the missing. In Fukushima, more than 100,000 families still cannot return home, says the Red Cross Society. This is because of radioactive pollution from the damaged Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant. In Japan, the disaster is known as \"3-1-1\" , marking the date five years ago. It was really three disasters rolled into one. \"It started with an earthquake devastating   in itself, then the tsunami, and then the radiation from the nuclear plant,\" said Shioko Goto, a Japan expert at the Wilson Center in Washington, D.C..Goto said the disaster showed the world, \"Japanese resilience   and Japanese unity.\" But it also showed shortcomings. Among the most notable, the long time it took to stabilize the Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant after it was flooded from the tsunami, Goto said. That process took eight months. Another, Japan's dependence on nuclear power, she said. The disaster forced Japan to close all of its nuclear power plants, leaving parts of the country without electricity. Goto offered up one major difference from the last major Japanese disaster, the 1995 Kobe Earthquake. In 2011, social media was everywhere, she said. Social media offered up plenty of \"unfounded rumors and fear-mongering  ,\" Goto said. But it also kept pressure on Japanese authorities to do more.

As Bonnie Bruce struggled to understand what the police officer was saying, her 11-year-old grandson, Elias, appeared in her bedroom doorway and walked to her bedside, listening. He knew: It was about his mother.\n\n\u201cWait a minute, what are you telling me?\u201d Bonnie gasped into the phone. The coil of dread lodged hard in her gut for the past 11 years, since her daughter first shot heroin into the soft crook of her elbow, abruptly gave way. \u201cIs she all right?\u201d\n\nBonnie thought of her daughter Tamara Bruce as two different people. When Tamara was clean, she was \u201cGoose\u201d or \u201cMara,\u201d the fun-loving mother of three who would bop outside to play pickup basketball with Elias, her oldest, or sprawl on the floor to color with her niece.\n\nBut when she was using, she was thin, distant, and deceptive. Bonnie had stopped keeping money in her house for fear that Tamara would steal it.\n\nGet Fast Forward in your inbox:\n\nForget yesterday's news. Get what you need today in this early-morning email.\n\nLately, that Tamara had come back, picking at her skin and avoiding questions.\n\nA mother and father are accused of driving from Vt. to Mass. to buy the drugs, then using them and passing out with their children in the vehicle.\n\nNow, hours after vanishing the night after Thanksgiving, Tamara had been found, passed out with her fiance, Jacob Davis, in Lawrence, Mass., more than three hours from home. They had been shooting up with their two little boys, 2-year-old Charles and a 9-month old Knox, in their idling car, the officer explained.\n\nBonnie hung up, and Elias started to cry. She and her husband rushed out the door to make the same drive Tamara had made a few hours before. When they dropped Elias at their other daughter\u2019s house, they hugged him goodbye in the driveway.\n\n\u201cWhatever you do, Nana, go get my brothers,\u201d the boy pleaded as the fog pressed in. \u201cYou and Poppy go get my brothers and bring them back, and I\u2019ll help you take care of them.\u201d\n\nTamara and Jacob\u2019s Nov. 25 arrest made headlines across New England, their glassy-eyed mugshots atop the terrible details: the passerby who thought they were dead, the seat belt wrapped like a tourniquet around Jacob\u2019s arm as he slumped on the steering wheel, Charles curled on Tamara\u2019s lap, Knox sleeping in the back seat.\n\nThe story fit the grim emerging genre of the opioid epidemic: addicted caregivers who imperil their young children, their very public failings instantly held up for excoriation on social media. Tamara and Jacob had abruptly been added to a national tableau, fused in the popular imagination with the Ohio couple slowly turning blue in their SUV while a 4-year-old watched from his carseat; the Milwaukee pair revived with Narcan in front of the woman\u2019s 2-year-old son; the woman who overdosed in the toy aisle of a Lawrence dollar store, while her toddler wailed and pulled at her arm.\n\nMuch less visible are the lives behind the headlines, especially of those who are trying to help the broken get whole again, and to bring life and hope to the children.\n\n\u201cI was reading the comments on one of the articles, and people were like: \u2018They\u2019re losers. Scumbags. Castrate him and sterilize her, take those kids away,\u2019 \u201d said Tamara\u2019s sister, Megen Niquette, who works as an RN at Southwestern Vermont Medical Center.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t even know that there are people to take care of those kids, and they\u2019re here. And this has been a long struggle for her.\u201d\n\nIt started just weeks after Elias was born in October 2005, when Tamara, 21 and struggling with postpartum depression, disappeared with him for four days. When she came back, Bonnie and her husband of 37 years, Ron, took the baby. A short time later, Tamara and her boyfriend went to the emergency room with abscesses on their arms from injecting heroin, and the state\u2019s child welfare agency became involved, according to her family and court documents.\n\nBonnie and Ron have raised Elias ever since, in the home where they brought up their two daughters. On and off, they have helped care for Tamara\u2019s two other young children, too. Since Tamara was found in Lawrence, they have had custody of all three. The Globe is identifying the children by their middle names to protect their privacy.\n\nIn an opioid crisis that shows little sign of subsiding, it\u2019s an increasingly common arrangement. In Vermont, where heroin and fentanyl fatalities have risen sharply in recent years, substance abuse was a factor in about 28 percent of reports to the state\u2019s child welfare agency in 2015. The Bruces are among an estimated 2.6 million grandparents nationally who care for their grandchildren, according to the US Census Bureau. That number has climbed as opioids have ensnared a wide swath of young parents, leaving them sick, incarcerated, or dead.\n\n\u201cThe story is all too familiar,\u201d said Brenda Hamlin, a specialist with Vermont Kin as Parents, a group that supports relatives who take custody of a family member\u2019s children.\n\nAlmost all of them are grandparents. When the organization formed in 2005, mental health issues were the primary reason custodial grandparents got involved. Now, it\u2019s opioids, she said.\n\nTheir stories follow a pattern, Hamlin said.\n\nThe addicted parent was caught with drugs; was jailed; asked their mother to watch the kids and then vanished, leaving the child\u2019s room littered with needles. Police get involved, and summon child welfare.\n\nBy the time grandparents are called to the rescue, they have often already been pouring money into supporting their child, from rent and groceries to addiction treatment. They must then raise a second generation, often burning through savings and working well into their retirement years.\n\nAt 63, Bonnie has beaten cancer and had her left knee replaced three times. She spends many mornings cooking behind the line at Up for Breakfast, a country-style restaurant she owns. When she comes home to her family\u2019s 3-acre property in Dorset, a rural town of 2,000 about two hours south of Burlington, she and her husband change diapers and referee sibling squabbles.\n\n\u201cI do not want to have babies again,\u201d Bonnie admits. \u201cAt my age, who in their right mind would?\u201d\n\nThe Bruces\u2019 house is warm, centered around an open kitchen, and decorated with portraits of Tamara, Megen, and Bonnie and Ron\u2019s five grandchildren. The whole family usually gets together on Dec. 2, Tamara\u2019s birthday, and puts up a Christmas tree. But this year, Tamara turned 33 in jail, after her parents refused to bail her out when she was arrested in Lawrence.\n\nThrough her attorney, Tamara declined to comment for this story. Jacob\u2019s attorney said his client is happy to be receiving treatment for his addiction in jail. Bonnie and Megen recalled Tamara\u2019s long battle with addiction and its impact on their family in a lengthy interview at Bonnie and Ron\u2019s home. Their account was supported by extensive criminal and probate court records.\n\nSome people tell Bonnie she and Ron should have given the young boys up, Bonnie said, let the system take them.\n\n\u201cWe could do that. We could have not gone and got them,\u201d she said.\n\nBonnie paused. Knox had just settled down after a bottle. After a tantrum, Charles was nestled in her arms, his head pressed to her chest.\n\n\u201cBut what kind of people would we be, really?\u201d she asked.\n\nCaleb Kenna for the Boston Globe\n\nA family photo of Tamara.\n\nDuring her first stint in rehab after Elias\u2019s birth, Tamara\u2019s letters home were hopeful.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t wait to get back to work with you, mom, and do some catering jobs. Dad, maybe if you need some help in the afternoon after I get out of the restaurant, maybe I could help you?\u201d she wrote in August 2006. Bonnie still keeps the note in a box in the basement, along with all her daughter\u2019sother promises.\n\n\u201cMeg I can\u2019t wait to come home and go tanning with you . . . I want to hang out with you more. We always have so much fun together.\u201d\n\nIn the letters, Tamara seemed eager to repair what she had broken. But her resolve was no match for the drugs. In the first year of Elias\u2019s life, she overdosed twice, according to court records. In January 2008, she was charged with disorderly conduct after flying into a rage in a 7-Eleven. A week later, she was arrested again after a physical fight with Bonnie, Megen, and Megen\u2019s boyfriend Ben, who is now her husband, that ended when she took off in Megen\u2019s car, running over Ben\u2019s foot. She went back to rehab.\n\nBonnie and Ron couldn\u2019t understand it. Tamara had been an insecure teenager, often fretting to her mother that people didn\u2019t like her. And she didn\u2019t like to talk about her feelings. But mostly, she was a bright, promising girl with her father\u2019s infectious laugh and a fierce devotion to Megen, her older sister by three years.\n\nWhen she would get tired of Tamara following her around, Megen would announce she was going out by herself and hop in her car.\n\nTamara would stand in the doorway howling after her \u2014 \u201cMegen? You\u2019re not going to take me?\u201d Megen always came right back. They were a tight family.\n\nTamara started to take pills in her late teens, and she graduated to heroin after Elias\u2019s birth, according to her family. But after the 2008 stint in rehab, sobriety seemed to stick.\n\nShe gained back the weight she had lost. She lived with her parents and helped take care of Elias. She got a good job as a parts manager for a car dealership, where she met Jacob. The new couple took Elias and Megen\u2019s son fishing for trout in Emerald Lake and out to the movies.\n\nHer family hoped she would stay healthy, but there were warning signs. Several times, when Bonnie and Tamara were together, people from Tamara\u2019s old life followed her around, trying to get close enough to press drugs into her hand.\n\n\u201cI live one day at a time with her,\u201d Bonnie said. \u201cHeroin is the worst thing in the world.\u201d\n\nThree years ago, on their last family vacation before everything fell apart again, Bonnie, Tamara, and Megen took Elias and Megen\u2019s son and daughter to Old Orchard Beach in Maine, as they did every summer.\n\nThey ate lobster. Megen and Tamara got matching sweat shirts. At the carnival, Megen and Elias went on all the rides and Tamara played all the long-shot games. Megen keeps a picture from that trip, taken just after she and Tamara had won giant stuffed monkeys. They grin widely in their sweat shirts: sisters who have forgiven past mistakes.\n\nBut just a few months later, in the fall of 2013, Tamara was pregnant, afraid, and back on drugs, according to her family and court documents. She started stealing checks from her parents, which angered Bonnie and Ron, though they saw it as a cry for help.\n\nThey were desperate to get Tamara into treatment. They had already attempted to detox her once, at home, after being unable to find a spot in rehab: Tamara had curled up in her bed, shaking, sweating, and crying from the withdrawal. Bonnie had lain beside her, murmuring encouragement.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m here, we\u2019ll get through this together,\u201d she\u2019d said.\n\nBut Tamara had been inconsolable.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t! I can\u2019t!\u201d she\u2019d cried. \u201cJust do something for me, mom!\u201d After a week, Bonnie had left to go to work. When she got back, she said, Tamara was gone.\n\nBonnie approached an old friend, Michael Hall, the police chief in Manchester, the next town over. Over the years, Hall said, the small, pretty town where he grew up has changed from a place where people only locked the doors to keep the dog from getting out into one where people install home security cameras. Some of that is just the way the world is now, he said. But some of it is the heroin.\n\n\u201cBonnie and her family are hard-working, middle-class Americans who earned everything they got. Their kids are good people,\u201d Hall said. \u201cAnybody that thinks they couldn\u2019t find themselves in a similar situation \u2014 be thankful.\u201d\n\nEven with Hall\u2019s help, Tamara couldn\u2019t find a bed in a rehab center. Bonnie remembers standing in her kitchen with Tamara when they found out there was no place for her to go.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to be like this, mom!\u201d Tamara screamed, again and again. \u201cDo you think I want to be like this, mom? I don\u2019t want to be like this, mom! But I can\u2019t help it!\u201d\n\nCaleb Kenna for the Boston Globe\n\nAnother family photo of Tamara, left.\n\nCharles was born Jan. 30, 2014, his tiny body racked by his mother\u2019s addiction. He would spend the first weeks of his life in a hospital, as tortured as his mother had been during her withdrawal.\n\nAbout six weeks after the baby was born, Bonnie and Ron\u2019s television and safe disappeared. They had decided not to press charges over the stolen checks, hoping Tamara would get treatment instead. This time, they called the police.\n\nTamara and Jacob told investigators a long story about a drug dealer and a debt, according to court documents, but in the end Tamara pleaded guilty to grand larceny and a host of forgery and uttering charges. She had cashed nearly $9,000 worth of her parents\u2019 checks.\n\nCharles spent months in the care of the state before Bonnie and Ron took him into their home, sharing custody with their daughter.\n\nTamara Bruce, left, and her sister Megen, after winning stuffed monkeys in a carnival game at Old Orchard Beach in 2013.\n\nBonnie begged Tamara to get her tubes tied. But Tamara said Jacob wanted a little girl, Bonnie recalled, and by late 2015, she was pregnant again.\n\nMegen knew that if Tamara couldn\u2019t stay healthy, Bonnie would wind up with all three of her children. Someday, the boys would fall to Megen and her husband to care for.\n\n\u201cThis constant knowing: Ultimately, we have two kids, but we really have five kids,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s sad to say, when my parents are gone, I will be responsible for these children. They will be mine.\u201d\n\nTamara\u2019s third baby, another boy she named Knox, was born healthy in March. In October, Tamara was granted sole custody of Charles, Bonnie said. Tamara, Jacob, and their two boys were living in a tidy white trailer that Bonnie and Ron bought for them, with dark green shutters and a little yard enclosed by a white picket fence. It was good, for a time.\n\nOn Nov. 25, Tamara and Jacob spent the day with Bonnie, working at Up for Breakfast. Bonnie was teaching Jacob to cook, and Tamara hostessed. But she kept getting phone calls and text messages from out of state numbers, waitresses told Bonnie.\n\nThey left the restaurant together around 2:30 p.m., and went to shop for children\u2019s clothes. But Jacob was so antsy in the store, Bonnie said she told him to wait outside.\n\nElias had a hockey game early the next morning in Burlington, and Tamara and was going to bring the boys to sleep over at Bonnie and Ron\u2019s so they could get an early start. A night of Thanksgiving leftovers and Lifetime TV stretched out ahead of them.\n\nWhen they left the store, Tamara kissed Bonnie and told her she loved her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll call in a little bit,\u201d she said.\n\nInstead, Tamara picked up Charles and Knox from their baby sitter, driving by her sister\u2019s house on the same street without stopping. As Bonnie peppered her cellphone with messages, Tamara and Jacob pointed their car toward Lawrence and drove out of town.\n\nAround 10:30 p.m., a man passing an AutoZone in Lawrence peered inside the car idling in the parking lot and saw what he thought were two dead people. He went to the police.\n\nOfficers found Tamara and Jake passed out, Charles on Tamara\u2019s lap, Knox asleep in the back seat. There was vomit on the passenger-side door, according to the police report. One of the officers tapped on the window, and Tamara and Jacob woke up groggy. Jacob rambled about meeting his brother but soon confessed that he and Tamara had shot heroin, police wrote in a report. He dropped to his knees and begged the officers not to arrest them, to no avail.\n\nAs they took Tamara into custody, she told officers that it was a mistake, according to the police report. She couldn\u2019t lose her kids.\n\nCaleb Kenna for the Boston Globe\n\nA week later, Bonnie was standing in the cracker aisle at the supermarket picking up last-minute groceries for a nearly 300-person Christmas party she was catering that day. Her phone rang. It was Tamara, calling from the rehab where she was waiting for her next court date.\n\nBonnie handed her credit card to a waitress who was with her and walked out to her car to talk.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday, Mar. But this isn\u2019t a happy day,\u201d Bonnie said, recalling the conversation. \u201cI just want to ask you, what the hell were you thinking? Why in hell did you drive three hours with those children in the car, when we were right here?\u201d\n\nTamara sobbed into the phone. She couldn\u2019t explain.\n\nBonnie knew her daughter needed money transferred into accounts at rehab and jail, but she had the Christmas party to put together, an event Tamara and Jacob were supposed to have helped her with. Bonnie was tired. She had been hurt by news reports and suggestions that her daughter had overdosed in Lawrence rather than passed out, and that Charles had been dirty when the police found them. She used to blame herself for Tamara\u2019s drug problem, but not anymore. She had raised her daughters the same. She loved her daughter, fiercely, but Tamara was sick. It had stolen so much of Bonnie\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cI really can\u2019t talk right now,\u201d Bonnie said. \u201cGive me the numbers I\u2019ve got to call to do this. I won\u2019t be able to do it for a while.\u201d\n\nShe said what she always did.\n\n\u201cI love you, Mama.

Michael Jackson received a songwriting credit for the sampling of the line \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\" from his 1983 single \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\". Tim Sturges and Phillip Ramos provided additional production for the song. It was recorded at Battery Studios in New York City and Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles by Mikkel S. Eriksen and Al Hemberger. Phil Tan and Josh Houghkirk mixed the single, and StarGate provided vocal production and instrumentation.In February 2009, Cameroonian musician Manu Dibango filed a lawsuit claiming that \"Don't Stop the Music\" and \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" used the \"Mama-say, mama-sa, ma-ma-ko-ssa\" hook without his permission. According to Dibango, the line is from his 1972 single \"Soul Makossa\". Agence France-Presse reported that Jackson admitted that he borrowed the line for \"Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'\" and settled out of court. When Rihanna asked Jackson in 2007 for permission to sample the line, he allegedly approved the request without contacting Dibango beforehand. Dibango's attorneys brought the case before a court in Paris, demanding \u20ac500,000 in damages and asking for Sony BMG, EMI and Warner Music to be \"barred from receiving 'mama-say mama-sa'-related income until the matter is resolved\". The judge ruled that Dibango's claim was inadmissible: a year earlier, a different Paris-area judge had required Universal Music to include Dibango's name in the liner notes of future French releases of \"Don't Stop the Music\", and at the time of this earlier court appearance, Dibango had withdrawn legal action, thereby waiving his moral right to seek further damages.\"Don't Stop the Music\" was the fourth single from Rihanna's third album, Good Girl Gone Bad (2007).

It is at the south-western tip of the North Island, between Cook Strait and the Rimutaka Range. Wellington is the major population centre of the southern North Island and is the administrative centre of the Wellington Region, which also includes the Kapiti Coast and Wairarapa. As the nation's capital city, the New Zealand Government and Parliament, Supreme Court and most of the civil service are based in the city.  - The Tasman Sea (Mori: \"Te Tai-o-Rehua\") is a marginal sea of the South Pacific Ocean, situated between Australia and New Zealand. It measures about across and about from north to south. The sea was named after the Dutch explorer Abel Janszoon Tasman, who was the first recorded European to encounter New Zealand and Tasmania. The British explorer Captain James Cook later extensively navigated the Tasman Sea in the 1770s as part of his first voyage of exploration.  - QS World University Rankings is an annual publication of university rankings by Quacquarelli Symonds (QS). Previously known as \"THE-QS World University Rankings\", the publisher had collaborated with \"Times Higher Education magazine\" (\"THE\") to publish its international league tables from 2004 to 2009 before both started to announce their own versions. QS then chose to still use the pre-existing methodology while \"THE\" adopted a new one. The QS system now comprises the global overall and subject rankings, alongside five independent regional tables (Asia, Latin America, Emerging Europe and Central Asia, the Arab Region, and BRICS). It is the only international ranking to have received International Ranking Expert Group (IREG) approval, and is viewed as one of the most widely read of its kind, along with \"Academic Ranking of World Universities\" and \"Times Higher Education World University Rankings\". However, allocating undue weight to subjective indicators and having highly fluctuating results are its major criticisms.  - Cornelius Cardew (7 May 193613 December 1981) was an English experimental music composer, and founder (with Howard Skempton and Michael Parsons) of the Scratch Orchestra, an experimental performing ensemble. He later rejected experimental music, explaining why he had \"discontinued composing in an avantgarde idiom\" in his own programme notes to his Piano Album 1973 in favour of a politically motivated \"people's liberation music\".  - Elizabeth II (Elizabeth Alexandra Mary; born 21 April 1926) has been Queen of the United Kingdom, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand since 6 February 1952. She is Head of the Commonwealth and Queen of 12 countries that have become independent since her accession: Jamaica, Barbados, the Bahamas, Grenada, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands, Tuvalu, Saint Lucia, Saint Vincent and the Grenadines, Belize, Antigua and Barbuda, and Saint Kitts and Nevis.  - Howard While Skempton (born 31 October 1947) is an English composer, pianist, and accordionist.  - A musical ensemble, also known as a music group or musical group, is a group of people who perform instrumental and/or vocal music, with the ensemble typically known by a distinct name. Some music ensembles consist solely of instruments, such as the jazz quartet or the orchestra. Some music ensembles consist solely of singers, such as choirs and doo wop groups. In both popular music and classical music, there are ensembles in which both instrumentalists and singers perform, such as the rock band or the Baroque chamber group for basso continuo (harpsichord and cello) and one or more singers. In classical music, trios or quartets either blend the sounds of musical instrument families (such as piano, strings, and wind instruments) or group together instruments from the same instrument family, such as string ensembles (e.g., string quartet) or wind ensembles (e.g., wind quintet). Some ensembles blend the sounds of a variety of instrument families, such as the orchestra, which uses a string section, brass instruments, woodwinds and percussion instruments, or the concert band, which uses brass, woodwinds and percussion.   - The New Zealand Order of Merit is an order of chivalry in New Zealand's honours system. It was established by royal warrant on 30 May 1996 by Elizabeth II, Queen of New Zealand, \"for those persons who in any field of endeavour, have rendered meritorious service to the Crown and nation or who have become distinguished by their eminence, talents, contributions or other merits\", to recognise outstanding service to the Crown and people of New Zealand in a civil or military capacity.  - New Zealand is an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean. The country geographically comprises two main landmassesthat of the North Island, or Te Ika-a-Mui, and the South Island, or Te Waipounamuand numerous smaller islands. New Zealand is situated some east of Australia across the Tasman Sea and roughly south of the Pacific island areas of New Caledonia, Fiji, and Tonga. Because of its remoteness, it was one of the last lands to be settled by humans. During its long period of isolation, New Zealand developed a distinct biodiversity of animal, fungal and plant life. The country's varied topography and its sharp mountain peaks, such as the Southern Alps, owe much to the tectonic uplift of land and volcanic eruptions. New Zealand's capital city is Wellington, while its most populous city is Auckland.  - The Scratch Orchestra was an experimental musical ensemble founded in the spring of 1969 by Cornelius Cardew, Michael Parsons and Howard Skempton.  - Philip Dadson is a New Zealand musician and artist , who was in the foundation group for the Scratch Orchestra and founder of From Scratch . He was made an Arts Laureate by the Arts Foundation of New Zealand in 2001 , and an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit in 2005 . He lectured at the Elam School of Fine Arts , part of the University of Auckland from 1977 , leaving in 2001 to take up full - time art practice . He co-authored the 2007 book Slap Tubes and other Plosive Aerophones with fellow instrument inventor Bart Hopkin , whose 1998 CD / book Gravikords , Whirlies & Pyrophones had also featured Dadson 's group From Scratch .  - The Elam School of Fine Arts, founded by John Edward Elam, is part of The University of Auckland. Students study degrees in fine art with an emphasis on a multidisciplinary approach. The school is located across three buildings, the Mondrian building, Building 431 (or the \"Main\" fine arts building), and Elam B, which includes the studios for postgraduate and doctoral students on Princes Street, in central Auckland, New Zealand.  - Tectonic uplift is the portion of the total geologic uplift of the mean Earth surface that is not attributable to an isostatic response to unloading. While isostatic response is important, an increase in the mean elevation of a region can only occur in response to tectonic processes of crustal thickening (such as mountain building events), changes in the density distribution of the crust and underlying mantle, and flexural support due to the bending of rigid lithosphere.  - The University of Auckland is the largest university in New Zealand, located in the country's largest city, Auckland. It is the highest-ranked university in the country, being ranked 81st worldwide in the 2016/17 QS World University Rankings. Established in 1883 as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand, the university is made up of eight faculties over six campuses. It has a head count of more than 40,000 students, and more than 30,000 equivalent full-time students.  - The North Island or Te Ika-a-Mui (\"Mori\") is one of the two main islands of New Zealand, separated from the slightly larger but much less populous South Island by Cook Strait. The island's area is , making it the world's 14th-largest island. It has a population of   - The Southern Alps (Mori: K Tiritiri o te Moana ) are a mountain range extending along much of the length of New Zealand's South Island, reaching its greatest elevations near the island's western side. The term \"Southern Alps\" generally refers to the entire range, although separate names are given to many of the smaller ranges that form part of it.  - The South Island or Te Waipounamu (\"Mori\") is the larger of the two major islands of New Zealand, the other being the smaller but more populous North Island. It is bordered to the north by Cook Strait, to the west by the Tasman Sea, and to the south and east by the Pacific Ocean. The South Island covers and is influenced by a temperate climate.  - In European academic traditions, fine art is art developed primarily for aesthetics or beauty, distinguishing it from applied art that also has to serve some practical function, such as pottery or most metalwork.  - Tonga (or ; Tongan: \"Puleanga Fakatui o Tonga\"), officially the Kingdom of Tonga, is a Polynesian sovereign state and archipelago comprising 169 islands of which 36 are inhabited.

Another major influence in his work was the rise of interest in vernacular architecture. By the time Douglas moved to Chester, the black-and-white revival using half-timbering was well under way, and Douglas came to incorporate this style in his buildings in Chester and elsewhere. The black-and-white revival did not start in Chester, but it did become Chester's speciality. The first Chester architect involved in the revival had been Thomas Mainwaring Penson, whose first work in this genre was the restoration of a shop in Eastgate Street in the early 1850s. Other early Chester architects involved in the revival were T. A. Richardson and James Harrison and it came to be developed mainly by T. M. Lockwood and by Douglas. Part of Douglas's earliest work for the Grosvenor family, the entrance lodge to Grosvenor Park, used half-timbering in its upper storey; this is the first known use by Douglas of black-and-white. Other vernacular motifs were taken from earlier styles of English architecture, in particular, the Tudor style. These include tile-hanging, pargetting and massive brick ribbed chimney stacks. In this style, Douglas was influenced by the architects Nesfield and Shaw. Douglas also used vernacular elements from the continent, especially the late medieval brickwork of Germany and the Low Countries.A characteristic of Douglas's work is his attention to both external and internal detailing. Such detailing was not derived from any particular style and Douglas chose elements from whichever style suited his purpose for each specific project. His detailing applied particularly to his joinery, perhaps inspired by his experience in his father's workshop, and was applied both to wooden fittings and to the furniture he designed. A further Continental influence was his use of a Dutch gable. The most important and consistently used element in Douglas's vernacular buildings was his use of half-timbering, which was usually used for parts of the building.

The test flight fails as his right wing breaks, sending him crashing into the Seine River. Later after the incident, Woody is asked by his friend, CIA file clerk Harry, to perform what appears to be a civilian paper swap in Istanbul. Upon arriving in Istanbul, he meets a beautiful Soviet named Natalia Rambova, who poses as the Soviet civilian with whom the exchange is supposed to take place, but it is later revealed that she is in fact a KGB spy. Woody does not tell Natalia his real name, and instead fabricates his identity to her as a top American agent code-named \"Condorman\". During the encounter, Woody fends off a group of would-be assassins and saves her life by sheer luck before accomplishing the paper trade. Impressed by Woody, and disgusted by how she was treated by her lover/boss Krokov when she returns to Moscow, Natalia decides to defect and asks the CIA to have \"Condorman\" be the agent that helps her.Back in Paris, Woody's encounter with Natalia inspires him to create a super heroine patterned after her named \"Laser Lady\". He is then notified by Harry and his boss Russ that he is to escort a defecting Soviet agent known as \"The Bear\". Woody refuses to do the job, but when Russ reveals that \"The Bear\" is Natalia, he agrees to do it on the condition that the CIA provides him with gadgetry based on his designs.Woody meets up with Natalia in Yugoslavia and protects her from Krokov's henchmen led by the homicidal, glass-eyed assassin Morovich.

At the nearest vet clinic, the vet gently examined it. \"He's about eight months old and has two broken legs, but I would need X-rays to know how serious the damage is,\" he told me. \"As he's not your cat, I don't know if you want to go ahead with this. It could be rather expensive.\" I knew it would cost me hundreds of dollars, but I agreed with his advice. The following morning the vet rang to say the X-rays confirmed two bad breaks in his legs. \"I'll operate on his legs and put metal pins in them to keep them fixed.\" he told me. That afternoon I went to pick up my little friend. There I could hardly recognize him. His previously dirty fur was now a beautiful silver grey. His front legs were in two casts and he lay there looking at me, purring  happily. I thanked the doctor and went out to pay the bill. \"I think you've given me the wrong account,\" I said to the clerk. \"This is only $85. He's had X-rays and an operation on his legs.\" \"No, that's right,\" she replied. \"The vet has only charged you for the medication. There's a message on the bottom.\" Written under the total were the words \"SPECIAL RATE FOR ADOPTIONS.\" I was speechless at his kind and generous gesture. I paid the account and under his message I wrote \"WITH GRATEFUL THANKS, CAT AND MUM.\" Question: What do we know about the author?

Please help improve it by removing unnecessary details and making it more concise. (August 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) In 1955, William Smith (Jeremy Irons), a widower, lives with his nine-year-old son, Danny (Samuel Irons), in a vardo behind the filling station and garage where he works in the English countryside. The land that the station and garage is built upon is coveted by businessman Victor Hazell (Robbie Coltrane), who owns the surrounding land and lives in a large mansion several miles away. He attempts to buy the Smiths' land, but William turns down his offers. Used to getting his own way, he begins a campaign of harassment, trying to force them off their land. Several inspectors from the local council come and assess William's property, and it becomes obvious that Hazell has sent them there by alerting them with false stories. William decides to poach Hazell's prized game pheasants in retribution, using raisins to lure them out, but comes home empty handed; Danny had detected his absence and was relieved to see him return. Afterwards, he reveals that he was out poaching. A while afterwards, William informs Danny that he will be going out poaching again at night. Danny wakes up during the night, detects his absence (he had promised to be back three hours before), and decides to go and look for him. He heads for the forest at the wheel of a vintage Austin Seven that William had been repairing, but on the way there he passes a police car, which turns around to pursue him after the officers realized that the car was being driven by an underage driver. He manages to shake them off by darting through a gap in the roadside hedges and driving along a country lane until he reaches the forest. He then spots two gamekeepers and hides from them, but then he hears them talking to someone in a deep hole in the ground; when they walk off to tell Hazell, Danny goes over and finds that the man in the hole is William,...\nAnswer:", "Premise: A group of teenagers in red shirts are smiling.\n\nHypothesis: The teenagers sleeping in the bus.\n\n.Can we conclude that the hypothesis is true if the premise is true?", "Title: Most useful pan in my cupboard. Product review: My wife and I came from different backgrounds. She swore by Calphalon before anyone else in our group ever started buying high end pans and I was almost exclusively stainless. As a result, our household now contains Calphalon, All-Clad, and a couple of stainless lined copper Mauviels.I bought the braiser about five years ago. It handles frying, sauteing, and braising beautifully. I don't flip with a 13\" pan so not having another pan handle in the way on the stove is a real convenience. The domed lid provides good circulation and the pan itself spreads the heat quite evenly.The best part is that after turning out a great meal, this pan is a breeze to clean. (A trick I stole from Calphalon is, if need be, I can throw in some cleanser and let it soak. Nothing withstands that.)My wife has now come around to preferring All-Clad as a result of this pan. As her pans lose the anodized coating, we're simply replacing them with All-Clad.

Movie title: Cat People Context: Jane Randolph in the trailer for Cat People At the Central Park Zoo in New York City, Serbian-born fashion designer Irena Dubrovna makes sketches of a black panther. She catches the attention of marine engineer Oliver Reed, who strikes up a conversation. Irena invites him to her apartment for tea. As they walk away, one of Irena's discarded sketches is revealed as a panther impaled by a sword. At her apartment, Oliver is intrigued by a statue of a medieval warrior on horseback impaling a large cat with his sword. Irena informs Oliver that the figure is King John of Serbia and that the cat represents evil. According to legend, long ago the Christian residents of her home village gradually turned to witchcraft and devil worship after being enslaved by the Mameluks. When King John drove the Mameluks out and saw what the villagers had become, he had them killed. However, \"the wisest and the most wicked\" escaped into the mountains. Oliver buys her a kitten, but upon meeting her it hisses. Irena explains that \"cats just don't like me\" and suggests they go to the pet shop to exchange it, but when they enter the shop the animals go wild in her presence. The shopkeeper says that animals can sense things about people. It gradually becomes clear that Irena believes she is descended from the cat people of her village, and that she fears that she will transform into a panther if aroused to passion. Despite her odd beliefs, Oliver persuades her to marry him. However, during the dinner after their wedding at a Serbian restaurant, a catlike woman walks over and asks Irena if she is \"\u00d0\u00bc\u00d0\u00be\u00d1\u0098a \u00d1\u0081\u00d0\u00b5\u00d1\u0081\u00d1\u0082\u00d1\u0080a\" (moya sestra, \"my sister\").

Article: Those accustomed to looking through thousands of books in big bookstores may find  Japan's Morioka Shoten a little strange.That's because this tiny bookstore that is located in  luxury shopping district of Ginza,in Tokyo offers just one title to its customers. Opened in May 2015,Morioka Shoten(Japanese for bookstore)is the brainchild of Yoshiyuki Morioka.The experienced bookseller began his career as a bookstore clerk in Tokyo's Kanda district before branching out to open his own store.It was here while organizing book readings that he realized that customers usually came into the store with one title in mind.Morioka began to wonder if a store could exist by selling many copies of just one single book.In November 2014,he partnered with his two friends,to establish a unique bookstore with the idea'A Single Room,A Single Book.' Like its offering,the bookstore is simple.The selections that are picked by Morioka change weekly and vary widely to attract customers with different interests.Recent choices include The True Deceiver,all award-winning Swedish novel by Tove Jansson,Hans Christian Andersen's Fairy Tales.and a collection of artist Karl Blossfeldt's photography of plants.Morioka has also displayed books written by famous Japanese authors Mimei Ogawa and ito Akagi. To highlight his single offering,Morioka often uses clever methods.For example,when selling a book about flowers,he decorated his shop with the ones that had been mentioned in the book.He also encourages featured authors to hold multiple talks and discussions so they can connect with customers.Morioka says his ultimate goal is for the customers to perience being inside a book,not just a bookstore! Risky as the idea might seem,things appear to be going well.Morioka says he has sold over 2,100 books since he opened it.Things can only get better given that his bookstore is becoming increasingly popular not just among the locals but also visitors from other countries* Question: How does Morioka highlight the weekly offered book?

Clearwater is the smallest of the three principal cities in the Tampa-St. Petersburg-Clearwater metropolitan area, most commonly referred to as the Tampa Bay Area.  - Tampa Bay is a large natural harbor and estuary connected to the Gulf of Mexico on the west central coast of Florida, comprising Hillsboro Bay, McKay Bay, Old Tampa Bay, Middle Tampa Bay, and Lower Tampa Bay. The surrounding area is home to about 4 million residents, making it a heavily used commercial and recreational waterway but putting much stress on the bay's ecosystem, which once teemed with enough wildlife to easily support an extensive indigenous culture.

A thunderstorm appears out of nowhere, and smoke pours from the ground. Lightning strikes the column. The monster Rawhead Rex rises from the dirt. Howard meets Declan O'Brien (Ronan Wilmot), who directs him to Reverend Coot. The curious O'Brien approaches the altar and places his hand on it. Images flash before his eyes.

Context: Jason Munt said him and Carly Furnish got beamed up by a bunch of aliens just after he'd boldly gone with her in the car park woods. It was the boldly going bit people thought was bullshit. Carly Furnish was a good God-loving girl. Trouble was, she'd gone missing. And Jason Munt had a weird crescent-shaped branding in his back, and was sticking to his story. Jason got hauled in by the cops and told he was in a whole heap of trouble. He reported blinding lights and a feeling like floating. He described being strapped to a table by little green men. A cop slapped the table and shouted, 'there's a frigging girl out there.' Jason said he knew how it sounded - the little green men, the whole thing - but it's true: they were little and green, just like out of the comic books. He volunteered tests for drink and drugs. He came back negative on both counts. They left him to stew. He said the last he saw of Carly was her being sucked up in some kind of light ray. He said, 'she seemed asleep - all peaceful, like.' Jason could not explain why he'd been beamed back down to earth, yet they'd seemingly taken Carly all the way off home with them to the Planet Zog. There were plenty of people willing to reckon it proved aliens had mighty good taste, but it wasn't the time nor the place to say it out loud. The cops released Jason after two days of questions.

Most of them are likely to feel dissatisfied with their reflection in the mirror. It is quite possible that men looking in the mirror are either pleased with what they see or indifferent. Research shows that men generally have a much more positive body-image than women---if anything, they may tend to over-estimate their attractiveness. Some men looking in the mirror may literally not see the flaws in their appearance. Why are women so much more self-critical than men? Because women are judged more on their appearance than men, and standards of female beauty are considerably higher and more inflexible. Women are continually bombarded   with images of the \"ideal\" face. And constant exposure to idealized images of female beauty on TV, magazines and billboards makes exceptional good looks seem normal and anything short of perfection seem abnormal and ugly.  It has been estimated that young women now see more images of outstandingly beautiful women in one day than our mothers saw throughout their entire adolescence. Also, most women trying to achieve the impossible standards of female beauty have in fact become progressively more unrealistic during the last century. In 1917, the physically perfect woman was about 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighed nearly 10 stone. Even 25 years ago, top models and beauty queens weighed only 8% less than the average women, now they weigh 23% less. The current media ideal for women is achievable by less than 5% of the female population---and that's just in terms of weight and size. If you want the ideal shape, face etc., it's probably more like 1%. Question: The passage is mainly to   _  .

We admire Washington, Jefferson and Adams, but they remain creatures of the 18th century. The man we encounter in \"Benjamin Franklin\"--funny, pragmatic and selfaware -- seems like one of us, or at least someone we'd like to be. Unlike Washington's cherry tree, Franklin's kite was real. His experiments with electricity made him one of the great scientists of his day. He was a middleclass businessman whose success as a printer and a journalist allowed him to retire at 42--and he devoted the rest of his life to his country. He was diplomat who persuaded the French to back the American Revolution and the author of the first great American autobiography. He was an excellent swimmer. There was almost nothing he couldn't do well, except write poetry. But what truly distinguished Franklin was his talent of being great and human at the same time. He owned slaves as a younger man, but in his last years became an abolitionist .When he fathered an illegitimate  son, he acknowledged his fatherhood and took the responsibility of raising the boy. He seems strange today in the joy he took in compiling and creating all  those self- improvement  _ he published in Poor Richard's Almanac  -- \"early to bed, early to rise\" and so on. Generations of lazy boys could have been happier without that. But he was no hypocrite . Isaacson tells us Franklin practiced what he preached, and often laughed at  _ while he did so.

In court, Irons reveals Burke's role in the incident and Burke is dismissed from the military. Because his weapons resulted in Sparks becoming a paraplegic, Irons resigns in disgust. Meanwhile, Burke hatches a plot to sell Irons' weapons to criminal gangs, recruiting a video arcade manager to help him carry out this deed. Irons witnesses a bank robbery organized by gang members wielding Burke's modified guns; they escape before he can interrogate them on where they obtained the weapons. The gang does not tell Irons anything when confronted directly in their hideout. Irons visits Sparks in a veteran's hospital and takes her to his own assembled laboratory, where he hopes he and Sparks can create weapons needed to combat the criminals.

Memory \"trick\" works the other way as well. Once in a while you remember not doing something, and then find out that you did.

The condition hits nearly everyone -- an estimated 1.2 billion sufferers are predicted by 2020, according to one study.\n\nThe GlassesOff app also claims it may even give you \"super-vision\" beyond the 20/20 standard your optometrist shoots for.\n\n\u201cSuper-vision is a side effect,\u201d said Nimrod Madar, president and CEO of the Israeli app-maker.\n\n- Nimrod Madar, president and CEO of GlassesOff\n\nIt sounds impossible -- yet it\u2019s real, and based on a very simple yet groundbreaking discovery, Madar explained. \u201cVision actually happens in the brain,\u201d he told FoxNews.com.\n\nEyes may be windows to the soul, but like a window, they\u2019re simply panes of glass. You don\u2019t see with your eyes, Madar explained. Eyes are the lenses on a digital camera; your brain is the computer chip that interprets the light signals and translates them into a picture.\n\nThe eye captures light, the brain interprets that data -- and the app can in theory alter how the brain does that.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re changing the way the brain interprets that information,\u201d he said.\n\nThe GlassesOff app works by presenting special designs called Gabor patterns -- fuzzy, vertical bars that look vaguely like elbow macaroni or jail cell bars (such images are widely used in vision research). In sessions that last 12 to 15 minutes, the app trains the user to look for these patterns as they flash on-screen for a fraction of a second. By varying the size, orientation shape and contrast of the patterns, neurons in the brain are stimulated, he explained.\n\nBeyond that, what exactly the app is doing to the brain is a topic up for debate, explained Uri Polat, chief science officer for the company and the brains behind the brain trainer. It may make neurons more efficient, by building new synapses. Or it may stimulate them to release more chemicals, strengthening the signals they send.\n\nRegardless, it seems to work.\n\nIn a 2012 paper published in the prestigious journal Nature, Polat and Dennis Levy, chief of optometry at University of California, Berkeley, described the effectiveness of the procedure for training the brain.\n\n\u201cWe show that perceptual learning (repeated practice on a demanding visual task) results in improved visual performance in presbyopes, enabling them to overcome and/or delay some of the disabilities imposed by the aging eye,\u201d they wrote. \u201cThis improvement was achieved without changing the optical characteristics of the eye.\u201d\n\nPolat has spent 20 years studying neuroscience and vision; he detailed the process first in a 2004 paper in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\n\nThe technology holds promise for the future as well, potentially improving reading speed for children, reaction times for athletes or depth perception. The company is in the early stages of testing a version with diagnostic potential as well.\n\nThe app isn\u2019t cheap, though it starts out so. It\u2019s free for a few weeks testing. If a consumer decides it works, he\u2019ll have to buy the full app, which costs $59. Then there\u2019s a subscription price to maintain the brain\u2019s newfound visual acuity.\n\nMadar defended the cost of the app, which is among the more expensive apps in a market dominated by $0.99 downloads.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t just another game. This is a very sophisticated scientific application,\u201d he said.\n\nThe first effects of presbyopia occur in the early 40s. The app is ideally suited for people aged 40 to 60, he explained. But a quick 8 to 10 minute test will forecast expected improvements for anyone curious about how it will work.\n\nThe app is for the iPhone and iPad only at present, but it doesn\u2019t hinge on the \u201cRetina\u201d display in that device -- an Android version should be released in the next few months.\n\nJeremy A.

The Education of Henry Adams by Henry Adams Published in 1918, the book was an autobiography. Born in one of America's most famous political families, Adams provides insight into his family, including his experience as private secretary to his father, minister to England during the American Civil war. Leaves of Grass by Walt Whitman When Whitman published Leaves of Grass in 1855, he wanted to accurately describe the American experience and reflect the great changes in the American literary world that had taken place during his lifetime. Poems by Emily Dickinson An enthusiastic poet whose works have had considerable influence on modern poetry, Dickson's frequent use of dashes, occasional capitalization  of nouns, and unconventional metaphors  have contributed to her reputation as one of the most inventive poets of the 19thcentury American literature. However, most of her poems were not published during her lifetime.

The first half of the film revolves around the administrators and officials of Cape Colony, notably the supremely arrogant Lord Chelmsford (Peter O'Toole) and the scheming Sir Henry Bartle Frere (John Mills), who both wish to crush the neighbouring Zulu Empire, which is perceived as a threat to Cape Colony's emerging industrial economy. Bartle Frere issues an impossible ultimatum to the Zulu king, Cetshwayo (Simon Sabela), demanding that he dissolve the Zulu Empire. Cetshwayo refuses, providing Cape Colony with a pretext to invade Zululand. Despite objections from leading members of Cape Colony's high society and from Great Britain itself, Bartle Frere authorises Lord Chelmsford to lead a British invasion force into Zululand.The second half of the film focuses on the British invasion of Zululand and the lead-up to the climatic Battle of Isandlwana. The invading British army, laden with an immense network of supply wagons, invades Zululand and marches in the direction of Ulundi, the Zulu capital. British forces, eager to fight a large battle in which they can unleash their cutting-edge firearm military technology against the vast Zulu army, become increasingly frustrated as the main Zulu army refuses to attack the British, and fighting is restricted to a few small skirmishes between British and Zulu scouts.Concerned that their supply lines are becoming overstretched and that the main Zulu army is still at large, British troops begin torturing captive Zulu warriors in an effort to learn the location and tactics of the Zulu army. Halfway to Ulundi, Chelmsford halts his army at the base of Mount Isandhlwana, ignoring the advice of Boer attendants to entrench the camp and laager the supply wagons, leaving the camp dangerously exposed. During the night, Colonel Durnford (Burt Lancaster) and an escort of 50 mounted Basutos approach the camp.

Interleague play was first introduced in the 1997 Major League Baseball season. Prior to that, matchups between AL teams and NL teams occurred only during spring training, the All-Star Game, other exhibition games (such as the Hall of Fame Game in Cooperstown, New York), and the World Series. Unlike modern interleague play, none of these contests, except for the World Series, counted toward official team or league records.\n\nIs this statement correct \"do american league and national league play each other\"?", "Information:  - The Scottish Football League (SFL) was a league featuring professional and semi-professional football clubs mostly from Scotland. From its foundation in 1890 until the breakaway Scottish Premier League (SPL) was formed in 1998, the SFL represented the top level of football in Scotland. After 1998, the SFL represented levels 2 to 4 of the Scottish football league system. In June 2013, the SFL merged with the SPL to form the Scottish Professional Football League.  - Scotland (Scots: ) is a country that is part of the United Kingdom and covers the northern third of the island of Great Britain. It shares a border with England to the south, and is otherwise surrounded by the Atlantic Ocean, with the North Sea to the east and the North Channel and Irish Sea to the south-west. In addition to the mainland, the country is made up of more than 790 islands, including the Northern Isles and the Hebrides.  - Ayrshire is a historic county in south-west Scotland, located on the shores of the Firth of Clyde.  It is also, under the name the County of Ayr, a registration county. Its principal towns include Ayr, Kilmarnock and Irvine. Like the other counties of Scotland, it currently has no administrative function, instead being sub-divided into the council areas of North Ayrshire, South Ayrshire and East Ayrshire. It has a population of approximately 366,800.  - The Old Firm is the collective name for the Scottish football clubs Celtic and Rangers, who are both based in Glasgow. The origin of the term is unclear but may derive from the two clubs' initial match in which the commentators referred to the teams as \"like two old, firm friends\", and represents the commercial benefits of the two clubs' rivalry. The name may also be a reference to these two teams being among the original 11 members of the Scottish Football League formed in 1890. The rivalry between the two clubs has become deeply embedded in Scottish culture and has contributed to the political, social and religious division in Scotland and also beyond, especially in neighbouring Northern Ireland. As a result, the fixture was recognised as having enduring appeal.  - The Scottish Junior Football Association (\"SJFA\" for short) is an affiliated national association of the Scottish Football Association and is the governing body for the junior grade of football in Scotland. The term \"junior\" refers to the level of football played, not the age of the players. The closest equivalent terminology would be non-League football in England, the difference being that non-league football in Scotland is not similarly integrated into its football league system. Founded in 1886, the SJFA is responsible for disciplinary matters within the grade, certain player registration procedures and organising the annual Scottish Junior Cup. Other league and cup competitions are organised by three regional committees. The association headquarters are at Hampden Park, Glasgow, which is Scotland's national football stadium. There was an earlier Scottish Junior FA, which was founded in Glasgow in October 1880. This body also ran a Scottish Junior Cup competition during 188081 season but appears to have disbanded at the end of that season.  - The Scottish Premier League (SPL) was the top level league competition for professional football clubs in Scotland. The league was founded in 1998, when it broke away from the Scottish Football League (SFL). It was abolished in 2013, when the SPL and SFL merged to form the new Scottish Professional Football League, with its top division being known as the Scottish Premiership. A total of 19 clubs competed in the SPL, but only the Old Firm clubs, Celtic and Rangers won the league championship.  - Robert Stevenson `` Bobby '' Donnelly ( born 19 January 1987 ) is a Scottish professional footballer currently playing as a defender for Kirkintilloch Rob Roy in the Scottish Junior Football Association , West Region .

Girvan is stituated on the east coast of the Firth of Clyde, with a population of about 6,700. It lies south of Ayr, and north of Stranraer, the main ferry port from Scotland to Northern Ireland.  - South Ayrshire is one of 32 council areas of Scotland, covering the southern part of Ayrshire. It borders onto Dumfries and Galloway, East Ayrshire and North Ayrshire. South Ayrshire Council is a Conservative controlled council. The administrative boundaries were formed in 1996 as a direct successor to the Kyle and Carrick district council area, with the district of Dalmellington - located along the south-east of Kyle and Carrick - being transferred over to the newly formed East Ayrshire Council area. South Ayrshire also forms part of the east coast of the Firth of Clyde.  - The Scottish Junior Football Association, West Region is one of three regions of the SJFA which organise their own distinct league and cup competitions. The SJFA used to be split into six regions, but in 2002 they took the decision to reform into three to try to ensure more games between the top clubs and hence increase their revenues.

Article: The fictional Chinese-American detective Charlie Chan was the subject of popular books and movies for many decades. In recent years, however, the character has been criticized as an ill image of Asian-Americans. Yunte Huang, an English professor at the University of California, says that's not the case. He has been exploring the character and real-life policeman who inspired him. Charlie Chan has been a familiar character to readers and film-goers, beginning in the 1920s. The detective solved crimes around the world in more than 40 films through the 1940s, and with the invention of television, found a new audience in the 1950s and 1960s. Huang discovered Charlie Chan through books by American author Earl Derr Biggers, who created the character. \"One day, I happened to find two Charlie Chan novels. At that point I thought I knew that he was a negative character against Asians, but when I read the book,\" he says, \"I was immediately attracted. Ever since then, I've been a fan of Charlie Chan.\" As a fan of the books and films, Huang was surprised to learn that Charlie Chan was based on a real detective named Chang Apana, who was born to Chinese parents in Hawaii around 1871. Apana worked as a cowboy, and joined the Honolulu police force in 1898. \"He almost immediately became a local legend because as a former cowboy,\" says Huang, \"he would walk the most dangerous areas in Chinatown carrying a bullwhip instead of a gun. He didn't need that.\" Although some say the image of Charlie Chan, with his broken English, is embarrassing for Asian-Americans, Huang believes Chan's broken English and unusual ancient sayings were part of his charm . \"Let me just quote a few - 'Actions speak louder than French,' or 'Mind like parachute  . Only function when open.' Charlie Chan always owes these instructive sayings to Confucius' eastern wisdom. For Huang, the fictional Charlie Chan is highly entertaining, while the real-life policeman, Chang Apana, is a Chinese-American success, whose story is worth telling. Question: It can be inferred from the passage that   _  . Options: A: American author Earl Derr Biggers gave an ill picture of Asian-Americans B: Yunte Huang believes Charlie Chan represents Asian wisdom in some way C: Chan's story was more popular with TV audience than readers and film-goers D: Charlie Chan became an ill image of Asian-Americans when it first appeared.\nAnswer:", "I am verifying the answers generated by an automatic system to the following question: where is the person who played \"joey stivic\" in all in the family Suggested answer: Joey Stivic was the son and only child of Mike Stivic (played by Rob Reiner ) and Gloria Stivic (played by Sally Struthers ), and the grandson of Archie Bunker ( Carroll O'Connor ) and Edith Bunker ( Jean Stapleton ).

Alkan's large scale Duo (in effect a sonata) Op. 21 for violin and piano (dedicated to Chr\u00e9tien Urhan) and his Piano Trio Op. 30 appeared in 1841. Apart from these, Alkan published only a few minor works between 1840 and 1844, after which a series of virtuoso works was issued, many of which he had played at his successful recitals at \u00c9rard and elsewhere; these included the Marche fun\u00e8bre (Op. 26), the Marche triomphale  (Op. 27) and Le chemin de fer (also published, separately, as Op. 27). In 1847 appeared the Op. 31 Pr\u00e9ludes and his first large-scale unified piano work, the Grande sonate Les quatre \u00e2ges (Op. 33). The sonata is structurally innovative in two ways; each movement is slower than its predecessor, and the work anticipates the practice of progressive tonality, beginning in D major and ending in G\u266f minor. Dedicated to Alkan Morhange, the sonata depicts in its successive movements its 'hero' at the ages of 20 (optimistic), 30 (\"Quasi-Faust\", impassioned and fatalistic), 40 (domesticated) and 50 (suffering: the movement is prefaced by a quotation from Aeschylus's Prometheus Unbound). In 1848 followed Alkan's set of 12 \u00e9tudes dans tous les tons majeurs Op. 35, whose substantial pieces range in mood from the hectic Allegro barbaro (no. 5) and the intense Chant d'amour-Chant de mort (Song of Love \u2013 Song of Death) (no. 10) to the descriptive and picturesque L'incendie au village voisin (The Fire in the Next Village) (no. 7).A number of Alkan's compositions from this period were never performed and have been lost. Among the missing works are some string sextets and a full-scale orchestral symphony in B minor, which was described in an article in 1846 by the critic L\u00e9on Kreutzer, to whom Alkan had shown the score. Kreutzer noted that the introductory adagio of the symphony was headed \"by Hebrew characters in red ink ...

Article: Early risers are most likely to be healthy, wealthy and wise, according to the old saying. But those who are early to bed and early to rise do not always have advantages, researchers say. They have found that night owls  are generally brighter and wealthier than those who are able to get up early in the morning. Experts from the University of Madrid carried out tests on around 1,000 teenagers and found that those who preferred to stay up late showed the kind of intelligence to find good jobs and earn much money. Larks or \"morning people\", however, often get better exam results, possibly because lessons are held at the wrong time of day for night owls. The researchers examined the habits and body clocks of the young people to determine whether they liked to stay up late and sleep later in the morning, or preferred to go to bed early and were at their best state in the morning. School performance and problem solving ability, were judged and test grades in the major subjects were also taken into consideration. Jim Horne, professor of psychophysiology at Loughborough University, said: \"Evening types tend  to be the more creative types, the poets, artists and inventors, while the morning types are considered to be civil servants and accountants . \" Question: In Jim Horne' opinion, Larks may choose to be   _   in the future.

Jason suggests increasing the amount Shelley is fed, but the ever-kindly Sherman argues against it, saying it could be dangerous.He then has an unpleasant meeting with Dean Richmond (Larry Miller). The Dean tells him that the incident with the hamsters has cost the science department most of its funding.

Several decades later, Gregory now works as a \"Spook,\" a roving witch hunter. The rise of the centennial blood moon allows Malkin to regain much of her power and break free from her prison. In a confrontation with the aged Gregory, she kills his apprentice, William Bradley, before escaping. Gregory then seeks out Tom Ward, the seventh son of a seventh son, on a local farmstead, and recruits him as his newest apprentice. Before Tom leaves, his mother gives him her necklace as a talisman. On their way to Gregory's home, Tom sees a girl about to be burned by a mob as a witch. Recognizing her from clairvoyant visions he has had, he takes her from the mob and releases her. The girl, Alice, warns him not to let Gregory know about her. Malkin returns to her dilapidated mountain fortress, restoring it, and her sister, Bony Lizzie, to their former condition. Alice is revealed to be Lizzie's daughter, who spies on Gregory for her. Malkin begins gathering her army to conquer mankind.

Should I validate this answer?\n\nChoices:\nA). No;\nB). Yes;\nThe answer is:", "Wladyslaw Gomulka (Polish: [vwa'diswaf go'muwka]; 6 February 1905 - 1 September 1982) was a Polish communist politician. He was the de facto leader of post-war Poland until 1948. Following the Polish October he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomulka was initially very popular for his reforms; his seeking a \"Polish way to socialism\"; and giving rise to the period known as \"Gomulka's thaw\".\n\nIn the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (Krajowa Rada Narodowa, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomulka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Cominterm leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Malgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomulka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.  The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body's chairman Bierut was becoming Gomulka's main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN's existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.  Gomulka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain a Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Wladyslaw Gomulka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.  On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osobka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomulka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital.

(October 2011) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) The story opens with Jake Taylor (Randy Wayne) a high school student in the suburbs of San Diego attending the funeral of his ex-best friend Roger (Robert Bailey Jr.). After Roger's mom comes and asks Jake if Roger had said anything to him, she walks away, and Jake remembers that this all started back when they were young boys and best friends. Roger pushed Jake out of the way of a car, saving him but crippling himself forever. During their freshmen year of high school, after Jake had made the winning basket in a basketball game, a freshman cheerleader named Amy invited him to a party that Roger was not let into. In the years later Jake joined a new popular group of friends, Amy became his girlfriend, and he became star of the basketball team. Jake grew further away from Roger, who became more of a loner due to his condition which he was bullied for. Three years later as a high school senior, Roger came in with a gun and began to shoot. Jake, knowing what Roger was going to do, tries to stop him, but Roger tells him that it was too late. Jake watches in horror as Roger shoots himself. Roger dies from his injuries, killing 5 classmates in the process, prompting Jake to wonder if he could have saved him by being a better friend. After the final basketball game of his senior year, Jake meets Chris, a youth pastor, who had spoken at Roger's funeral. Jake goes to a party that is broken up by the police and, being slow to orient himself, is the last to sneak out of the house. Amy had taken his truck, and he was without a ride home. With no other options left, Jake decides to call the number on the business card Chris gave him. On the ride home, Chris reveals that Roger had come to church the Sunday before he killed himself. Chris expresses guilt that no one had really welcomed him there.

The 1980 Bank Robbery in Central Nyack that was medically managed at the Nyack Hospital where I responded to the ONLY Code 66 of my career. That \u201c66\u201dindicated for us an external disaster about to unload in our emergency room. The two policemen who were mortally injured and died on our stretchers were personal friends and one the boyfriend of one of the nurses. Their injuries were from machine guns where the flesh is riddled with explosive elements as opposed to a gunshot wounds where there is both an entry and exit site. In our Trauma and Triage Course we never learned about machine gun injuries. Additionally there were the criminals who were also injured and of course we needed to treat them as any other patient regardless of their behavior. The friends of the injured policemen were trying to get to these villains and it was just the most awful evening of my life. To this day I remember feeling nauseous in a way I had never felt before. We had debriefing sessions for weeks and of course were very upset for months. The wounds we had to address, the insertion of chest tubes and everything else all in such a rapid manner was indeed a more than gross situation. There was even open heart massage. Private doctors reported to help; many are not trained or current in emergency medicine; much is left to critical care nurses in a community hospital that is not a teaching institution with residents and interns on staff. Recently one of the women involved in this crime came up for parole. Of course there was great opposition from the community relative to her release. She was young and that was 38 years ago. I believe people deserve a second chance, but of course this is a very controversial matter.

A major site of ApoD expression in mice is the central nervous system where evidence suggests that it plays a protective role. Gene expression of ApoD was reported in bone-forming osteoblasts but its impact on bone metabolism remains undocumented.', 'We compared basic bone parameters of ApoD(-/-) (null) and transgenic (tg) mice to wild-type (wt) littermates through microCT and histochemistry, as well as ApoD expression and secretion in osteoblasts under various culture conditions through real-time PCR and immunoblotting.', 'ApoD-null females displayed progressive bone loss with aging, resulting in a 50% reduction in trabecular bone volume and a 23% reduction in cortical bone volume by 9months of age. Only cortical bone volume was significantly reduced in ApoD-null males by an average of 24%. Histochemistry indicated significantly higher osteoblast surface and number of osteoclasts in femora from ApoD-null females. ApoD gene expression was confirmed in primary cultures of bone marrow mesenchymal cells (MSC), with higher expression levels in MSC from females compared to males. ApoD-null MSC exhibited impaired proliferation and differentiation potentials. Moreover, exogenous ApoD partially rescued the osteogenic potential of null MSC, which were shown to readily uptake the protein from media. ApoD expression was upregulated under low proliferation conditions, by contact inhibition and osteoblastic differentiation in MC3T3-E1 osteoblast-like cells.\nAnswer: Our results indicate that ApoD influences bone metabolism in mice in a gender-specific manner, potentially through an auto-/paracrine pathway.\nStudent:", "Detailed Instructions: Given a sentence in the Japanese, provide an equivalent translation in Filipino that retains the same meaning through the translation.

Sugaring is the process of desiccating a food by first dehydrating it, then packing it with pure sugar. This sugar can be crystalline in the form of table or raw sugar, or it can be a high sugar density liquid such as honey, syrup or molasses.  The purpose of sugaring is to create an environment hostile to microbial life and prevent food spoilage. Sugaring is commonly used to preserve fruits as well as vegetables such as ginger. From time to time sugaring has also been used for non-food preservations. For example, honey was used as part of the mummification process in some ancient Egyptian rites.  A risk in sugaring is that sugar itself attracts moisture. Once a sufficient moisture level is reached, native yeast in the environment will come out of dormancy and begin to ferment the sugars into alcohol and carbon dioxide. This leads to the process of fermentation. Although fermentation can be used as a food preservation method, it must be intentionally controlled, or the results will tend to be unpleasant.

If the concentration of a substance is decreased, the system will respond by favoring the reaction that replaces that substance. In the industrial Haber-Bosch process, NH 3 is removed from the equilibrium system as the reaction proceeds. As a result, the forward reaction is favored so that more NH 3 will be produced. The concentrations of N 2 and H 2 decrease. Continued removal of NH 3 will eventually force the reaction to go to completion until all of the reactants are used up.

The plane, piloted by Leland Bowman, was bringing Autumn home from a Montana visit.\n\nA National Transportation Safety Board team was expected to arrive on Thursday to investigate.\n\nThe teenager was released from a hospital on Tuesday. She provided searchers with the clues they needed to find the wreck.\n\nAlso on Wednesday, a different set of searchers located the wreckage of a small plane from Minnesota that crashed in northern Washington state with two aboard.

Kingdoms are divided into smaller groups called phyla. Traditionally, some textbooks from the United States used a system of six kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista, Archaea/Archaeabacteria, and Bacteria/Eubacteria) while textbooks in Great Britain, India, Australia, Latin America and other countries used five kingdoms (Animalia, Plantae, Fungi, Protista and Monera). Some recent classifications based on modern cladistics have explicitly abandoned the term \"kingdom\", noting that the traditional kingdoms are not monophyletic, i.e., do not consist of all the descendants of a common ancestor. \n\nWhen Carolus Linnaeus introduced the rank-based system of nomenclature into biology in 1735, the highest rank was given the name \"kingdom\" and was followed by four other main or principal ranks: class, order, genus and species. Later two further main ranks were introduced, making the sequence kingdom, phylum or division, class, order, family, genus and species. In the 1960s a rank was introduced above kingdom, namely domain (or empire), so that kingdom is no longer the highest rank. \n\nPrefixes can be added so \"subkingdom\" (\"subregnum\") and \"infrakingdom\" (also known as \"infraregnum\") are the two ranks immediately below kingdom. Superkingdom may be considered as an equivalent of domain or empire or as an independent rank between kingdom and domain or subdomain. In some classification systems the additional rank \"branch\" (Latin: \"ramus\") can be inserted between subkingdom and infrakingdom (e.g. Protostomia and Deuterostomia in the classification of Cavalier-Smith).\n\nAnswer the following questions:\n1.

His story is told in Livy's \"Ab Urbe Condita\" (written c. 27-25 BC).  - The Second Punic War, also referred to as The Hannibalic War and (by the Romans) the War Against Hannibal, lasted from 218 to 201 BC and involved combatants in the western and eastern Mediterranean. This was the second major war between Carthage and the Roman Republic and its allied Italic socii, with the crucial participation of Numidian-Berber armies and tribes on both sides. The two states fought three major wars with each other over the course of their existence. They are called the \"Punic Wars\" because Rome's name for Carthaginians was \"Poeni\", derived from \"Poenici\" (earlier form of \"Punici\"), a reference to the founding of Carthage by Phoenician settlers.  - Jugurtha or Jugurthen (c. 160  104 BC) was a King of Numidia, born in Cirta (modern-day Constantine).  - The Numidians were the Berber population of Numidia (present day Algeria) and in a smaller part of Tunisia. The Numidians were one of the earliest Berber tribes to trade with the settlers of Carthage. As Carthage grew, the relationship with the Numidians blossomed. Carthage's military used the Numidian cavalry as mercenaries. Numidia provided some of the highest quality cavalry of the Second Punic War, and the Numidian cavalry played a key role in a number of battles, both early on in support of Hannibal and later in the war after switching allegiance to the Roman Republic.  - Juba I of Numidia ( c. 85 BC -- 46 BC , reigned 60 BC -- 46 BC ) was a King of Numidia . He was the son and successor to King of Numidia Hiempsal II.  - Hiempsal II was a king of Numidia. He was the son of Gauda, half-brother of Jugurtha, and was the father of Juba I.   - The Massylii or Maesulians were a Berber federation of tribes in eastern Numidia, which was formed by an amalgamation of smaller tribes during the 4th century BC. They were ruled by a king. On their loosely defined western frontier were the powerful Masaesyli. To their east lay the territory of the rich and powerful Carthaginian Republic. Their relationship to Carthage resembled that of a protectorate. Carthage maintained its dominance over the Massylii by skillful diplomatic manoeuvering, playing off local tribal and kingdom rivalries. The principal towns of the Massylii were Cirta, T\u00e9bessa and Thugga.  - Algeria (' \"Dzayer\"), officially the People's Democratic Republic of Algeria, is a sovereign state in North Africa on the Mediterranean coast. Its capital and most populous city is Algiers, located in the country's far north. With an area of , Algeria is the tenth-largest country in the world, and the largest in Africa. Algeria is bordered to the northeast by Tunisia, to the east by Libya, to the west by Morocco, to the southwest by the Western Saharan territory, Mauritania, and Mali, to the southeast by Niger, and to the north by the Mediterranean Sea. The country is a semi-presidential republic consisting of 48 provinces and 1,541 communes (counties). Abdelaziz Bouteflika has been President since 1999.  - Numidia (202 BC  46 BC) was an ancient kingdom of the Numidians, located in what is now Algeria and a smaller part of Tunisia and Libya in the Maghreb. The polity was originally divided between Massylii in the east and Masaesyli in the west. During the Second Punic War (218-201 BC), Massinissa, king of the Massylii, defeated Syphax of the Masaesyli to unify Numidia into one kingdom. The kingdom began as a sovereign state and later alternated between being a Roman province and a Roman client state. It was bordered by the kingdom of Mauretania to the west, the Roman province of Africa (modern-day Tunisia) to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the north, and the Sahara Desert to the south.

Article: The Cuban iguana  is a species of lizard of the iguana family. It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas, one of the most endangered groups of lizards. This species with red eyes and a thick tail is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean. The Cuban iguana is mainly _ : 95% of its diet consists of the leaves, flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species, including the seaside rock bush and various grasses. However, Cuban iguanas occasionally eat animal matter, and individuals have been watched eating the dead flesh of birds, fish and crabs. The researchers wrote that quite a few people on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident. The Cuban iguana is living throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islands with a wild population growing rapidly on Isla Magueyes, Puerto Rico. It is also found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac, where a separate subspecies occurs. Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites half destroyed by Cuban crocodiles. To avoid the attack from them, the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly-pear cacti . In general the species is decreasing, more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islands. One of the reasons for their decrease is habitat destruction caused by the over consuming of farm animals, housing development, and the building of tourist resorts  on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests. Although the wild population is decreasing, the numbers of iguanas have been sharply increased as a result of captive-breeding and other protection programs.

Answer:\nAnswer:", "Write a title for this article:\n\nWhat sort of a man was American revolutionary Thomas Paine? Was he a charmer? Was he an irascible individualist? What would this English-born author of The Rights of Man--and arguably the draughtsman of U.S. independence--have been like to meet? Convivial guru or pain in the backside?\n\nA new play in London sets out to tell Paine's story, but it never quite drills down into the humanity of the fellow, real or imaginary. The play, which is showing at the open-air Globe theater, is more a work of biographical history than imaginative drama. The character of brave, reckless, fight-picking Paine himself is distinctly undercooked.\n\nOnetime Norfolk staymaker Paine did not emigrate to the American colonies until he was 37. What drove him? If we sat down today with him over a beer, what would we make of the bloke? Was he a disrespectful hell-raiser who hated all authority? Given the way he warmed to George Washington, this seems unlikely. Was he funny, prone to moods, a womanizer, a talker, a natural hack journalist? Was he maybe even, well, unreasonable?\n\nPaine is back in fashion. Barack Obama quoted him at his presidential inauguration ceremony and now we have this play, \"A New World.\" It does not bother with the first 37 years of his life. Time constraints would make that impossible. As it is, the show lasts for three hours; any longer than that and the audience at the Globe would have started to protest. The theater is a re-creation of a Shakespeare-era playhouse and has remarkably uncomfortable seats. Furthermore, half the audience has to stand.\n\nIt would have been good to show Paine as a young man. Were there incidents that molded his ideas? Was he always a free-thinker? Or was he pushed toward disenchantment by one particular injustice? No doubt such scenes were included in playwright Trevor Griffiths' original version of the story (the work has been 20 years in the making). That was five hours long.\n\nThe edited play concentrates more on Paine's political campaigns than on his rebellion against organized religion (one anti-church line in the show won a cheer of support from an elderly woman in the audience). In addition to his printed polemics against British rule, Paine became involved in the French revolution. The second half of the production has him largely in Paris. He did not have a happy time with the Frenchies. He got on the wrong side of the revolutionary feuding and was imprisoned for more than 10 months in 1794.\n\nIt is a lot to expect any dramatist to imagine the disenchantment and rage that the disowned prophet must have felt as he stewed in his Parisian gaol. Griffiths, a venerable old Leftie, seems more determined to pack in historical facts than dwell on Paine's personal dilemma. Historically, this was no doubt the more honorable option, but a little imaginative juice in these scenes would have made the play more watchable.\n\nGriffiths ends his play with a prediction that Paine's revolution will eventually reach Britain. Given his Marxist past, he presumably wants the British monarchy to be overthrown. Watching the story of Tom Paine, however, it struck me that if he came back to modern Britain he would be more likely to agitate against the modern, quasi-colonial power of the European Commission. As in mid-18th century America, there are here today irritating questions of taxation and representation and the imposition of rules by an absent landlord elite. In today's Blighty, some of us feel as resentful of Brussels as Benjamin Franklin and his associates did about London.\n\nIt so happens that Norfolk, Paine's old county, is a strong area for right-wing \"Eurosceptics\" who want Britain to tell our European masters where to go.

Plot title: Forty-Ninth Parallel Movie plot: Early in the Second World War, U-37, a German U-boat, makes its way to Canadian waters and participates in fictional anti-shipping activities similar to those that would later characterize the Battle of the St. Lawrence (which occurred in actuality some time after the film's release). The U-boat succeeds in evading an RCAF patrol and moves north. While a raiding party of six Nazi sailors is put ashore in an attempt to obtain supplies, the U-boat is sunk in Hudson Bay. The six attempt to evade capture by travelling across Canada to the neutral United States. Led by Lieutenants Hirth (Eric Portman) and Kuhnecke (Raymond Lovell), the small band of sailors encounter and sometimes brutalise a wide range of people, including the Eskimo Nick (Ley On), and a French-Canadian trapper (Laurence Olivier). Happening across a floatplane crew and local Eskimo onlookers, the group steals the aircraft and begins flying across Canada. Outside Winnipeg they attempt to stir up the Hutterite community, believing them to be sympathetic to the German cause. Lieutenant Hirth's stirring speech is rejected by Peter (Anton Walbrook), the community's leader, and even by one of their own, Vogel (Niall MacGinnis), who comes to the aid of Anna (Glynis Johns), a 16-year-old girl. Vogel, who would rather join the community and ply his trade of baker, is tried by Lieutenant Hirth and summarily executed for the greater crime of trying to break away from the Nazi group. Hijacking an innocent motorist for his car, Hirth, Lohrmann and Kranz flee west. With all of Canada searching for them, and having killed eleven civilians along the way, Lohrmann is arrested by Canadian Mounties at a public gathering. Next, Kranz confronts writer Phillip Armstrong-Scott (Leslie Howard) in a cave and despite wounding him is knocked cold.

These scientists are increasingly concerned about the potential long-term effects of global warming on our natural environment and on the planet. Of particular concern is how climate change and global warming caused by anthropogenic, or human-made releases of greenhouse gases, most notably carbon dioxide, can act interactively, and have adverse effects upon the planet, its natural environment and humans' existence. It is clear the planet is warming, and warming rapidly. This is due to the greenhouse effect, which is caused by greenhouse gases, which trap heat inside the Earth's atmosphere because of their more complex molecular structure which allows them to vibrate and in turn trap heat and release it back towards the Earth. This warming is also responsible for the extinction of natural habitats, which in turn leads to a reduction in wildlife population.The most recent report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (the group of the leading climate scientists in the world) concluded that the earth will warm anywhere from 2.7 to almost 11 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 to 6 degrees Celsius) between 1990 and 2100.  and the situation: Two identical planets, Norlon and Bothar, have been discovered in a neighboring galaxy of ours. These two planets have the same type of atmosphere as Earth and are extremely similar to Earth in terms of topography and even species of animals that live on them. The main difference is that Norlon is inhabited by a species very similar to humans that emit a lot of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. Bothar, however, has no such species on its planet.

Three species of mangrove trees exist in the region: red (Rhizophora mangle), black (Avicennia germinans), and white (Laguncularia racemosa), although all are from different families. All have the same characteristics: they are tolerant of salt, brackish, and fresh water; they grow in oxygen-poor soil; and they can survive drastic water-level changes. Black and white mangroves excrete salt from under their leaves, and red mangroves filter the salinity of sea water. All species are integral to coastline protection during severe storms. Red mangroves, for example, have far-reaching roots that trap sediments. The trees not only stabilize coastlines, but add land as more sand and decaying vegetation is trapped in the root systems. All three mangroves also absorb the energy of waves and storm surges. The estuaries act as fisheries for fry and nurseries for crustaceans. Shrimp, oysters, crabs, whelks, cockles, and snails thrive in these waters, as do primordial horseshoe crabs (Limulus polyphemus). The region supports a $59 million-a-year Tortugas pink shrimp (Farfantepenaeus duorarum) industry, and a $22 million-a-year stone crab (Menippe mercenaria) industry.  Between 80 and 90 percent of species that are harvested commercially in Florida are born or spend time in the shallow waters near the Everglades. Oysters and mangroves work in tandem to build up the coastline. The sand around the coastline has minute white particles of quartz and fine shells. When currents are right, oysters grow in colonies or beds, and deposit their shells, reinforcing the bed. Mangrove seeds, called propagules, are full embryos and float in water until they reach a favorable location and take root, often on oyster beds. They shed skin and litter, ensuring other trees will not compete for space and nutrients.Mangroves also serve as excellent rookeries for birds. Wading birds, such as roseate spoonbills (Platalea ajaja), egrets, and tricolored herons (Egretta tricolor) use the mangroves as a nursery, due to the proximity of food sources...\nA:", "Canelo \u00c1lvarez vs. Kermit Cintron was a Super-Welterweight championship fight for the WBC World title.

The U.S. states of Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas border the Gulf on the north, which are often referred to as the \"Third Coast\" in comparison with the U.S. Atlantic and Pacific coasts, or sometimes the \"south coast\", in juxtaposition to the Great Lakes region being the \"north coast.\" One of the gulf's seven main areas is the Gulf of Mexico basin.  - The Florida Legislature is the two houses that act as the state legislature of the U.S. state of Florida. The Florida Constitution states that \"The legislative power of the state shall be vested in a legislature of the State of Florida,\" composed of a Senate and House of Representatives. The legislature is seated at the Florida State Capitol in Tallahassee. Both chambers have been under Republican control since 1996.  - The Atlantic Ocean is the second largest of the world's oceans with a total area of about . It covers approximately 20 percent of the Earth's surface and about 29 percent of its water surface area. It separates the \"Old World\" from the \"New World\".  - Alabama is a state in the southeastern region of the United States. It is bordered by Tennessee to the north, Georgia to the east, Florida and the Gulf of Mexico to the south, and Mississippi to the west. Alabama is the 30th-most extensive and the 24th-most populous of the U.S. states. At nearly , Alabama has one of the nation's longest navigable inland waterways.  - A lower house is one of two chambers of a bicameral legislature, the other chamber being the upper house.  - Cuba, officially the Republic of Cuba, is a country comprising the island of Cuba as well as Isla de la Juventud and several minor archipelagos. Cuba is located in the northern Caribbean where the Caribbean Sea, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Atlantic Ocean meet. It is south of both the U.S. state of Florida and the Bahamas, west of Haiti, and north of Jamaica.

A poor man and his young son arrive exhausted at a small outpost. There, the man confronts Luke Fletcher (Donald O'Brien), a sneering crook in the employ of a rich and powerful landowner called Barret. The man tells Fletcher that Barret has swindled him and his son out of money for some non-existent land. The bitter altercation ends with the man shot dead right in front of his son. As the killer laughs sadistically, the little boy picks up his father's gun and shoots Fletcher dead. Impassively, the boy mounts Fletcher's horse, claiming it along with its ornate silver-trimmed saddle, and rides off.Several years later, the young boy has grown up into a rugged bounty hunter named Roy Blood (Giuliano Gemma) who rides into the Texan town of Cerriotts on his silver-saddled horse, accompanied by Two-Strike Snake (Geoffrey Lewis), an amusing but treacherous man he recently met. Snake tells Roy that many have heard the story of the Silver Saddle, and its owner, the boy who avenged his father. He also knows that Roy Blood seems to leave a trail of dead men in his wake. This is why he wants to tag along: Snake collects items of value from the frequent corpses encountered at every turn in the Wild West. Roy's arrival is also noted by Turner, a mysterious blond-haird cowboy (Gianni De Luigi).Roy meets with Shiba (Licinia Lentini), a well-to-do madam of the town's local whorehouse, who is also an old flame who wants more. She tells Roy that a man called Shep is extorting money from her, for a Mexican named Grenache (Aldo Sambrell). Her business will be ruined unless she pays up the following day. Roy obligingly shoots Shep and some of his cronies. Once again Snake turns up, shadowing Roy for spoils.

During his reign the Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organisation.  - Nikephoros I or Nicephorus I , also Logothetes or Genikos ( Greek :    , Nikphoros I , `` Bringer of Victory '' ; died July 26 , 811 ) , was Byzantine Emperor from 802 to 811 AD , when he was killed in the Battle of Pliska . A patrician from Seleucia Sidera , Nikephoros was appointed finance minister ( logothets tou genikou ) by the Empress Irene . With the help of the patricians and eunuchs he contrived to dethrone and exile Irene , and to be chosen as Emperor in her stead on October 31 , 802 . He crowned his son Staurakios co-emperor in 803 . His rule was endangered by Bardanes Tourkos , one of his ablest generals , who revolted and received support from other commanders , notably the later emperors Leo V the Armenian and Michael II the Amorian in 803 . But Nikephoros gained over the latter two , and by inducing the rebel army to disperse achieved the submission of Bardanes , who was blinded and relegated to a monastery . A conspiracy headed by the patrician Arsaber had a similar issue . Nikephoros embarked on a general reorganization of the Empire , creating new themes in the Balkans ( where he initiated the re-Hellenization by resettling Greeks from Anatolia ) and strengthening the frontiers . Needing large sums to increase his military forces , he set himself with great energy to increase the Empire 's revenue . By his rigorous tax imposts he alienated the favour of his subjects , and especially of the clergy , whom he otherwise sought to control firmly . Although he appointed an iconodule , Nikephoros as patriarch , Emperor Nikephoros was portrayed as a villain by ecclesiastical historians like Theophanes the Confessor . In 803 Nikephoros concluded a treaty , called the `` Pax Nicephori '' , with Charlemagne , but refused to recognize the latter 's imperial dignity . Relations deteriorated and led to a war over Venice in 806 -- 810 . In the process Nikephoros had quelled a Venetian rebellion in 807 , but suffered extensive losses to the Franks . The conflict was resolved only after Nikephoros ' death ,...  - The Battle of Pliska or Battle of Vrbitsa Pass was a series of battles between troops, gathered from all parts of the Byzantine Empire, led by the Emperor Nicephorus I Genik, and Bulgaria, governed by Khan Krum. The Byzantines plundered and burned the Bulgar capital Pliska which gave time for the Bulgarians to block passes in the Balkan Mountains that served as exits out of Bulgaria. The final battle took place on 26 July 811, in some of the passes in the eastern part of the Balkans, most probably the Vrbitsa Pass. There, the Bulgarians used the tactics of ambush and surprise night attacks to effectively trap and immobilize the Byzantine forces, thus annihilating almost the whole army, including the Emperor. After the battle, Krum encased Nicephorus's skull in silver, and used it as a cup for wine-drinking. This is one of the best documented instances of the custom of the skull cup.  - The Balkan mountain range (Bulgarian and , Latin Serbian Stara planina, \"Old Mountain\"; ) is a mountain range in the eastern part of the Balkan Peninsula. The Balkan range runs 560\u00a0km from the Vrashka Chuka Peak on the border between Bulgaria and Serbia eastward through central Bulgaria to Cape Emine on the Black Sea. The highest peaks of the Balkan Mountains are in central Bulgaria. The highest peak is Botev at 2,376 m, which makes the mountain range the third highest in the country, after Rila and Pirin. The mountains are the source of the name of the Balkan Peninsula.   - Pliska (, romanized: \"Plskov\") is the name of both the first capital of the First Bulgarian Empire and a small town situated 20\u00a0km Northeast of the provincial capital Shumen.  - The Byzantine Empire, also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire, was the continuation of the Roman Empire in the East during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, which had been founded as Byzantium). It survived the fragmentation and fall of the Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, cultural, and military force in Europe. Both \"Byzantine Empire\" and \"Eastern Roman Empire\" are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the \"Roman Empire\" (tr. ), or \"Romania\", and to themselves as \"Romans\".  - The First Bulgarian Empire (Old ) was a medieval Bulgarian state that existed in southeastern Europe between the 7th and 11th centuries AD. It was founded circa 681 when Bulgar tribes led by Asparukh moved to the northeastern Balkans. There they secured Byzantine recognition of their right to settle south of the Danube by defeating  possibly with the help of local South Slavic tribes  the Byzantine army led by Constantine IV. At the height of its power, Bulgaria spread from the Danube Bend to the Black Sea and from the Dnieper River to the Adriatic Sea.

The Forbidden City in Beijing was enveloped by floating sand and dust on March 18, 2008. These huge, sky-blackening dust storms sweep across Asia in March and April, bringing with them millions of tons of sand from inner Mongolia and depositing it in China and on across the Korean peninsula to Japan. During the past few years the storms have grown in ferocity and scale, and they are at the vanguard of an advancing Gobi desert that threatens more than 400 million people in the Chinese provinces of Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Ningxia and Shaanxi. The economic toll has been estimated to cost the Chinese economy $6.5 billion per year. But desertification is not limited to China and it is fast becoming a serious global problem that will only be exacerbated by climate change. In the Chinese provinces of Inner Mongolia and Xinjiang the causes are reasonably straightforward, and in many ways they area is an exemplar of the situation in developing countries worldwide. Rapid population growth has put enormous pressure on agricultural systems that have been pushed towards unsustainable farming practices in order to cope with demand. In China livestock numbers have nearly doubled in the last 30 years, from around 200 million in the early 1970's, to 427 million in 2002. As a result huge amount of marginal land has been taken in as pasture, overgrazed to the point of exhaustion, and now farmers are being forced to watch the topsoil literally blow away on the spring winds. In Africa demand for water has shrunk Lake Chad by 95 percent since the 1960s, leaving only sand and scrub. In Kazakhstan desertification has meant that nearly 50 percent of cropland has been abandoned since 1980. The Sahara is advancing into Ghana and Nigeria at the rate of 3,510 square kilometers per year. In Iran, fierce sandstorms are believed to have buried more than 100 villages in 2002. But this is only expected to get worse. Across the world climate change is set to exacerbate problems where poor land use and population pressure is already putting an immense strain on finely balanced ecologies. Africa may only be able to feed 25 percent of its population by 2025, according to the United Nations University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa. Many countries in the Mediterranean basin could face a future of significant food and water shortages as climate change bites and deserts spread. Already desertification is estimated to cost Spain US$200 million per year. Predicting the regional effect of climate change is always difficult, but some scientists are suggesting a four degrees rise in the Mediterranean by 2100, with an associated 10 percent to 40 percent drop in rainfall. A change on this scale would cause existing areas of desert to spread and exacerbate the problems associated with erosion, wildfires and the salinization of the water table. Already water supplies In Algeria, Egypt, Lebanon, Libya, Malta, Morocco, Syria and Tunisia are at or close to 1,000 cubic meters per person per year, which is widely taken as a benchmark for water scarcity. Globally crop yields are likely to fall substantially as the area of desert grows across Africa, the Middle East, the United States and Europe and this, coupled with associated rising prices for key crops such as maize and soybeans, could threaten food security in some countries. Scientists also predict that water shortages could increase the risk of supply contamination and associated diseases such as cholera and dysentery. Because desertification is often caused by population pressure, effective control is hard to achieve and many solutions are focused on dealing with the symptoms rather than the root cause of the problem. The Chinese government is creating a forest belt stretching 2,800 miles (4,500 kilometers) to block the advancing sands of the Gobi desert and diminish the effect of the sandstorms. The African Union is seeking support to fund a similar \"Green Wall\" to hold back the Sahara. In Algeria officials hope that the inauguration of the 250,000 hectare Taghit National Park will slow the advance of the sands. But for such schemes to work they will need to take account of local context and build what Camilla Toulmin, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development, calls \"a mosaic of local innovations.\" She cites the regeneration of trees around fields in central Niger, and the terraces for soil and water conservation in Burkina Faso as perfect examples. Many ecologists argue that it is small, simple, localized changes towards more sustainable patterns of land-use that will offer effective long-term solutions. For example, in many areas of the world the search for fuel for cooking fires puts enormous strain on the landscape: as trees are cut down, erosion increases and deserts spread. But the shift towards using cheap, fuel-efficient 'rocket stoves' and solar cookers could cut the amount of wood needed dramatically. Leguminous plants, such as beans, which 'fix' nitrogen from the air can be used to help restore fertility in already damaged areas. Belts of trees and grass can be used to reduce wind velocity and stop sand spreading, and provide a managed resource for local communities. In Spain, Sunseed Desert Technology, an organization that \"aims to develop, demonstrate and communicate accessible, low-tech methods of sustainable living in a semi arid environment\" has had enormous success renovating abandoned 1,000-year old Moorish irrigation systems. They believe that similar systems, alongside \"appropriate technology\" such as solar heaters and biogas producers, may offer a way to slow desertification in many other countries. What is becoming clearer year-by-year is that we can't fight the advancing desert - only by looking after the land can we expect it to look after us.

He is the biological son of wrestler Helen Nevins and Ted Wills, an entertainer and singer. He is the adopted son of wrestler \"Iron\" Mike DiBiase, who was Italian-American. DiBiase is of mostly German and English ancestry.\n\nDiBiase also spent time in the Georgia area where he had an early face run. One legendary angle had DiBiase enduring four piledrivers (one on the concrete floor and three in the ring) administered in the WTBS studio arena by The Fabulous Freebirds before his tag team partner, Tommy \"Wildfire\" Rich, threw in the towel (the angle of DiBiase being badly injured was so real the TBS studio audience could be seen crying). Rich and DiBiase later feuded, leading to a loser leaves town match which DiBiase won, but instead of Rich leaving the area, he donned a mask calling himself \"Mister R.\" The feud culminated in a match between Mister R and DiBiase, Rich appeared from backstage and distracted DiBiase. Mister R then rolled up DiBiase to get the win and unmasked as Brad Armstrong. Both DiBiase and Rich left the territory shortly thereafter.  In the early to mid-1980s, DiBiase participated in angles in various territories feuding with the likes of Ric Flair best known from this point in his Mid South return with the likes of Bob Roop, Paul Orndorff, Dick Murdoch, The Fabulous Freebirds and One Man Gang. DiBiase turned heel against the Junkyard Dog and formed a group called The Rat Pack with Jim Duggan and Matt Borne, ran Mid-south for months. Aligning with Skandor Akbar, Dibiase caused a riff with the group, namely Duggan. The two would feud until DiBiase lost a loser leave town match. He also held various championships and made frequent trips to All Japan Pro Wrestling until his eventual departure from Mid-South Wrestling (which by this point was now the UWF). Typically, his matches ended with the use of a \"loaded\" black glove, which he pulled from his tights to \"knock out\" his opponent when the referee was not looking.  While locked in talks with the National Wrestling Alliance in 1987 after the UWF was acquired by Jim Crockett, DiBiase received an offer from the WWF. DiBiase was eventually convinced by WWF to sign up despite the fact that he would not be told his gimmick until after he agreed, under the promise that it was something that would receive a serious push. WWF official Pat Patterson informed DiBiase that if owner Vince McMahon were to go out to wrestle, it would be the gimmick that he would give himself.

It includes the Migration art of the Germanic tribes on the continent, as well the start of the Insular art or Hiberno-Saxon art of the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic fusion in the British Isles. It covers many different styles of art including the polychrome style and the animal style.\n\nIn the 3rd century the Roman Empire almost collapsed and its army was becoming increasingly Germanic in make-up, so that in the 4th century when Huns pushed German tribes westward, they spilled across the Empire's borders and began to settle there. The Visigoths settled in Italy and then Spain, in the north the Franks settled into Gaul and western Germany, and in the 5th century Scandinavians such as the Angles, Saxons and Jutes invaded Britain. By the close of the 6th century the Western Roman Empire was almost completely replaced with smaller less politically organized, but vigorous, Germanic kingdoms.  Although these kingdoms were never homogeneous, they shared certain common cultural features. They settled in their new lands and become farmers and fishermen. Archaeological evidence shows no tradition of monumental artwork, such as architecture or large sculpture in permanent materials, but a preference instead for \"mobile\" art for personal display, usually also with a practical function, such as weapons, horse harness, tools, and jewelry which fastened clothes. The surviving art of the Germanic peoples is almost entirely personal adornment, portable, and before conversion to Christianity was buried with its owner. Much art in organic materials has no doubt not survived.  Three styles dominate Germanic art. The polychrome style originated with the Goths who had settled in the Black Sea area. The animal style was found in Scandinavia, north Germany and England. Finally there was Insular art or the Hiberno-Saxon style, a brief but prosperous period after Christianization that saw the fusion of animal style, Celtic, Mediterranean and other motifs and techniques.\n\nWhat happened in the 3rd century", "Write the next sentence in this paragraph:\n\nHow to make espresso macarons \nPreheat your oven to 350 degrees fahrenheit (178 celsius). \nMake sure your rack is on the third row down. \nPlace your almonds in a food processor.", "You will be given a definition of a task first, then some input of the task.\nYou are given a sentence in English.

I had a stress heart attack five years ago. My step-son is a heroin addict. He will be on an opioid agonist for the rest of his life. His behavior mirrored the worst of what addicts do to a family. I was desperate to make a change, and my husband was desperate to save his son\u2019s life. That meant having to watch my husband support my step-son as he abused me and my children. Multiple criminal behaviors, many times the police came to the house, two convictions, long-term parole. Watching him threaten to kill me, kill his father, and kill his younger brother and sister. Add to that a very stress job situation with a new boss who decided he needed a new VP, but had no basis to terminate my employment, so instead was determined to make my work life a living hell on earth. So, yep, I had a heart attack. I\u2019m still angry at everything that led up to the heart attack. I\u2019m working really hard on forgiving my husband, forgiving my step-son, and the overwhelming guilt of my children seeing me as an accomplice to their abuse. I found a new job, and then had the pleasure of seeing my former boss fired by the Board of Directors. Since then I find I\u2019m hyper-vigilant in issues of child abuse, worker abuse, addiction, lying and deceit (Trump trigger), and feeling somewhat betrayed by my husband.

The extra time you save her that day will allow her to do something else she enjoys. She will also appreciate your consideration in taking an active role in keeping your home clean and tidy.  Household chores could also mean taking care of children. Brushing teeth, going to the toilet, combing hair, getting dressed, and eating breakfast is a time-consuming process. If you can pitch in or take the responsibility away from your wife a couple days of a week, she will appreciate both the time you save her and your interest in the kids. If feeding, grooming, and taking the dog for a walk is not usually your responsibility, go ahead and take care of the dog or other pets once in a while. It will make both your wife and the pooch happy. A few nights a week, wash the dishes and silverware or even better, polish them. Try doing the same with the laundry, washing and ironing so she doesn't have to. Let your wife know how much you appreciate all the work she does around the house. There is little enjoyment in household chores, running the children all over town, and going grocery shopping, often while working another job as well. If you do not participate in any of these responsibilities, then let your wife know how impressed you are with her abilities to multitask.  Acknowledging your wife\u2019s hard work is important because there are few, if any, awards, salary increases, or promotions for the jobs she does around the house. She deserves the credit for keeping the family moving forward. Recognize your wife\u2019s contributions by telling her she is the reason why you call this a \u201chome\u201d and not a \"house.\u201d This will prove to her that you appreciate how she puts her heart, love, and skill into making this your home. Little things can make big things happen. Take notice if your wife gets a haircut, wears new jewelry, or changes a routine meal with new ingredients. She will be happy that you care enough to notice when she does something different.  Other little things you can do is hold your wife\u2019s hand if you are out taking a walk or put your arm around her when you are sitting together in front of the television. These little \u201clove messages\u201d let your wife know you still care and that you are happy that she is with you. Don\u2019t forget to say \u201cThank you!\u201d Remember, just because you are married does not mean that she is still not a woman, or human being.

He mentions that the citizens of Los Angeles have lost their \"sense of touch.\" Ria and the driver of the other car, Kim Lee, exchange racially charged insults. When Waters exits the car, he arrives at a police investigation crime scene concerning the discovery of \"a dead kid.\" Yesterday While purchasing a revolver at a gun store, Farhad (Shaun Toub), a Persian shop owner, and his daughter Dorri (Bahar Soomekh), argue in Persian over what box of bullets they should buy. The gun store owner grows impatient and degrades the two of them by referring to Farhad as \"Osama\". Farhad clarifies that he is an American citizen but the store owner continues exchanging racially stereotypical insults at Farhad and has the security guard escort him out of the store. Dorri demands the store owner to give her the gun or give her back the money. After the store owner gives the gun to Dorri, she asks for \"the ones in the red box\". The store owner asks why, but Dorri does not answer and insists on buying that particular box. In another part of town, two black men, Anthony (Ludacris) and Peter (Larenz Tate), argue over racial stereotyping of African Americans after Jean Cabot (Sandra Bullock), the wife of the local district attorney Rick Cabot (Brendan Fraser), walks in another direction whilst fearfully staring at them.

Given the paragraph above, please answer correctly the following question:   Which person's car, Jacob's or Alejandro's, must have accelerated faster?  Hint: Acceleration is a measure of the change in velocity of a moving object. It measures the rate at which velocity changes. Velocity, in turn, is a measure of the speed and direction of motion, so a change in velocity may reflect a change in speed, a change in direction, or both. Both velocity and acceleration are vectors. A vector is any measurement that has both size and direction. People commonly think of acceleration as in increase in speed, but a decrease in speed is also acceleration. In this case, acceleration is negative and called deceleration. A change in direction without a change in speed is acceleration as well.\nAnswer:", "Answer the following question: FINAL EXAM  Question 1.

It was too hot too cook in the kitchen, so Mom decided we\u2019d grill hot dogs & stuff outside. But we needed some things so Dad was elected to go to the grocery store. This turned out to be a big production; Dad was trying remember what all was needed without writing a list, and Mom kept adding things even as he was trying to leave. Finally, he got in the car and drove off. Mom & I had just turned around and sat down at our picnic table when all of sudden here was Dad pulling back into the driveway. He\u2019d apparently just driven around the block & came right back. Mom & I looked at each other and smirked- she was thinking the same thing I was: \u201cwhat\u2019d he forget this time?\u201d But then Dad got out of the car.. and on his face was the look. In my young life, I\u2019d never seen that look before, but it chilled me to the core and I just knew something bad was coming. Mom knew it too; the smirk quickly left her face as Dad came over and said.. \u201cMom.. I hope I heard this wrong.. but on the radio they said a woman drowned at the lake.. I hope I\u2019m wrong, I barely caught the name, but I think they said it was your sister..\u201d The cookout was forgotten; we went inside & started making phone calls, and unfortunately it was indeed my aunt. She & her family had gone swimming to cool off; apparently she\u2019d gotten a cramp or something and gone under while nobody was looking, and by the time she was missed it was too late.

Bill used mycorrizal fungi compost for the garden, while Hank used regular top soil. Bill was very happy with the harvest.  Which gardener had more mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant\u2019s root system?  Hint: A mycorrhiza (Greek for \"fungus roots\") is a symbiotic association between a fungus and the roots of a plant. In a mycorrhizal association, the fungus may colonize the roots of a host plant by either growing directly into the root cells, or by growing around the root cells. This association provides the fungus with relatively constant and direct access to glucose, which the plant produces by photosynthesis. The mycelia of the fungi increase the surface area of the plant\u2019s root system.

With energy and boundlessness they go and go and go. They mention the \"thing\" that they're apparently going to and how it should be there somewhere. They have no map.

A costumed reveler at a Captain Morgan party celebrates the rum named after the 17th century privateer. We put them in our cocktails, but how well do we know them? Here's some biographical detail on the men behind your favorite tipples:. 1. Captain Morgan. The Captain wasn't always just the choice of sorority girls looking to blend spiced rum with Diet Coke; in the 17th century he was a feared privateer. Not only did the Welsh pirate marry his own cousin, he ran risky missions for the governor of Jamaica, including capturing some Spanish prisoners in Cuba and sacking Port-au-Prince in Haiti. He then plundered the Cuban coast before holding for ransom the entire city of Portobelo, Panama. He later looted and burned Panama City, but his pillaging career came to an end when Spain and England signed a peace treaty in 1671. Instead of getting in trouble for his high-seas antics, Morgan received knighthood and became the lieutenant governor of Jamaica. Mental Floss: 5 drinking stories that put yours to shame. 2. Johnnie Walker. Walker, the name behind the world's most popular brand of Scotch whisky, was born in 1805 in Ayrshire, Scotland. When his father died in 1819, Johnnie inherited a trust of a little over 400 pounds, which the trustees invested in a grocery store. Walker became a very successful grocer in the town of Kilmarnock and even sold a whisky, Walker's Kilmarnock Whisky. Johnnie's son Alexander was the one who actually turned the family into famous whisky men, though. Alexander had spent time in Glasgow learning how to blend teas, but he eventually returned to Kilmarnock to take over the grocery from his father. Alexander turned his blending expertise to whisky, and came up with \"Old Highland Whisky,\" which later became Johnnie Walker Black Label. 3. Jack Daniel. Jasper Newton \"Jack\" Daniel of Tennessee whiskey fame was the descendant of Welsh settlers who came to the United States in the early 19th century. He was born in 1846 or 1850 and was one of 13 children. By 1866 he was distilling whiskey in Lynchburg, Tennessee. Unfortunately for the distiller, he had a bit of a temper. One morning in 1911 Daniel showed up for work early and couldn't get his safe open. He flew off the handle and kicked the offending strongbox. The kick was so ferocious that Daniel injured his toe, which then became infected. The infection soon became the blood poisoning that killed the whiskey mogul. Curious about why your bottle of J.D. also has Lem Motlow listed as the distillery's proprietor? Daniel's own busy life of distilling and safe-kicking kept him from ever finding a wife and siring an heir, so in 1907 he gave the distillery to his beloved nephew Lem Motlow, who had come to work for him as a bookkeeper. Mental Floss: The many myths of Jack Daniel. 4. Jose Cuervo. In 1758, Jose Antonio de Cuervo received a land grant from the King of Spain to start an agave farm in the Jalisco region of Mexico. Jose used his agave plants to make mescal, a popular Mexican liquor. In 1795, King Carlos IV gave the land grant to Cuervo's descendant Jose Maria Guadalupe de Cuervo. Carlos IV also granted the Cuervo family the first license to commercially make tequila, so they built a larger factory on the existing land. The family started packaging their wares in individual bottles in 1880, and in 1900 the booze started going by the brand name Jose Cuervo. The brand is still under the leadership of the original Jose Cuervo's family; current boss Juan-Domingo Beckmann is the sixth generation of Cuervo ancestors to run the company. 5. Jim Beam. Jim Beam, the namesake of the world's best-selling bourbon whiskey, didn't actually start the distillery that now bears his name. His great-grandfather Jacob Beam opened the distillery in 1788 and started selling his first barrels of whiskey in 1795. In those days, the whiskey went by the less-catchy moniker of \"Old Tub.\" Jacob Beam handed down the distillery to his son David Beam, who in turn passed it along to his son David M. Beam, who eventually handed the operation off to his son, Colonel James Beauregard Beam, in 1894. Although he was only 30 years old when he took over the family business, Jim Beam ran the distillery until Prohibition shut him down. Following repeal in 1933, Jim quickly built a distillery and began resurrecting the Old Tub brand, but he also added something new to the company's portfolio: a bourbon simply called Jim Beam. Mental Floss: A bourbon FAQ. 6. Tanqueray. When he was a young boy, Charles Tanqueray's path through life seemed pretty clear. He was the product of three straight generations of Bedfordshire clergymen, so it must have seemed natural to assume that he would take up the cloth himself. Wrong. Instead, he started distilling gin in 1830 in a little plant in London's Bloomsbury district. By 1847, he was shipping his gin to colonies around the British Empire, where many plantation owners and troops had developed a taste for Tanqueray and tonic. 7. Campari. Gaspare Campari found his calling quickly. By the time he was 14, he had risen to become a master drink mixer in Turin, Italy, and in this capacity he started dabbling with a recipe for an aperitif. When he eventually settled on the perfect mixture, his concoction had over 60 ingredients. In 1860, he founded Gruppo Campari to make his trademark bitters in Milan. Like Colonel Sanders' spice blend, the recipe for Campari is a closely guarded secret supposedly known by only the acting Gruppo Campari chairman, who works with a tiny group of employees to make the concentrate with which alcohol and water are infused to get Campari. The drink is still made from Gaspare Campari's recipe, though, which includes quinine, orange peel, rhubarb, and countless other flavorings. For more mental_floss articles, visit mentalfloss.com.

Running for 7 years and involving over 135,000 people, this was a very big study so its conclusions are right to take notice of. The key finding from the work that attracted the most media attention was that a high carbohydrate diet was linked with a higher risk of earlier mortality, whereas total fat and individual types of fat were related to a lower risk of earlier mortality. Digging deeper into the study, the research team found that global diets consisted of 61 percent energy coming from carbohydrates and 24 percent energy from fats. And while those in the highest carbohydrate consumption group (a whopping 77 percent of energy) had a higher risk of earlier death, it wasn\u2019t cardiovascular disease they were dying from.

But fame is fleeting, and these days the former chart-topper falls back on nostalgia to maintain a steady income, frequently performing at birthday parties and bar mitzvahs for the children of his former fans. When Bobby begins his week-long stand at the Mazel Hotel and casino, the head rabbis are flummoxed -- how did this hip-swinging gentile land a gig performing for Orthodox Jews? The answer to this question lies with Rebekka, the daughter of the hotel's owner. Rebekka has harbored a crush on Bobby since childhood, and it was she who suggested her father hire the has-been to help open the hotel. As Bobby begins planning what he hopes will be his comeback show, Rebekka rails against her prearranged marriage to the son of a prestigious Kabbalah rabbi.

Think again! When you look at the sky at night, the stars may appear to stay in the same place. But stars are always on the move--they are just so far away that the movement is hard to see. But some stars move in ways that appear to be strange to be real. In 2005, astronomer Warren Brown found one of these space oddities . It was located on the outer edge of the Milky Way, the galaxy  we live in. The star was speeding away like nothing he'd ever seen. \"It seemed unbelievable. No star in the galaxy has a speed like that,\" Brown remembers. \"I thought, oh my goodness, I have something kind of special here.\" No one had ever seen a star like this one. What does a scientist do when the results don't make sense? Brown didn't give up. Instead, he kept looking. And he kept finding more of these strange and speedy stars, called _ stars.

Article: Seth DeBolt is a plant scientist at the University of Kentucky US. He and other scientists wanted to find a source of fuel that poor people in rural areas of developing countries could use to make electricity. The United Nations Development Program says a billion and a half people have no electricity. A billion others have an undependable supply. Professor DeBolt went on a study trip to rural Indonesia. He saw that there was very little waste in the use of agricultural products. Everything that farmers grew was used for something. Even the remains of fruit that people did not eat were fed to chickens. Little waste meant there was little that could be used for fuel. Growing a separate fuel crop would take land away from food crops. That was something Professor DeBolt did not want to do. DeBOLT said, \"The people at most risk with respect to energy poverty, typically they're the same people who have food insecurity issues as it is. And then any change in availability would be most damaging to that group of people.\" But he found one item that was in plentiful supply and would not create competition between food and fuel. Coconut shells are generally thrown out. Yet Professor DeBolt says it has an \"excellent\" heating value. All someone needs is a way to release that energy. DeBolt says he and his team see possibilities for coconut power. \"Coconuts are growing here and these are the areas where there is possibility for energy poverty to be eased at least in part by these small-scale production systems.\" The researchers say these systems could provide as much as thirteen percent of the energy needs of a country like Indonesia. Other tropical countries with large crops of coconuts and similar fruit could benefit, as well. But DeBolt says this is not a perfect solution. There are technical questions, like how to safely deal with the dangerous waste produced in the process. And there needs to be money to get these projects started. Question: DeBolt thought it was not a good idea to grow fuel crops because  _  . - there are plenty of coconuts - local farmers have no interest in it - it would make food problems worse - fuel crop has little use for local farmers\nAnswer:", "Les utilisateurs du secteur commercial emploient aussi les donn\u00e9es issues du recensement des logements pour \u00e9valuer la demande possible de logements, mais aussi la demande d'\u00e9quipements et d'appareils m\u00e9nagers.\n\nTranslate to English", "Answer the following question: Ceratozamia robusta is a species of plant in the Zamiaceae family.

The unusual name stands out especially in Mandarin, which has no alphabet   and instead uses tens of thousands of multistroke   characters to represent words. \"The whole world uses it to write emails, and translated into Chinese it means 'love him',\" the father explained, according to the deputy chief of the State Language Commission Li Yuming. While the @ symbol is familiar to Chinese email users, they often use the English word \"at\" to sound it out. With a drawnout \"t\", this sounds something like \"ai ta\", or \"love him\", to Mandarin speakers. Li says the name is an extreme example of people's increasingly adventurous approach to Mandarin, as commercialization and the Internet break down conventions  . Another couple tried to give their child a name that in English sounds like \"King Osrina\". Li did not say if officials accepted the \"@\" name.

The group recorded songs by rock/folk songwriters such as Laura Nyro, James Taylor, the Band and the Rolling Stones as well as Billie Holiday and Erik Satie. They also incorporated music from Thelonious Monk and Sergei Prokofiev into their arrangements.\n\nClayton-Thomas left in early January 1972 to pursue a solo career. He was briefly replaced by Bobby Doyle and then Jerry Fisher, who went on to front the next incarnation of Blood, Sweat & Tears. Fred Lipsius left as well and was briefly replaced by Joe Henderson, before Lou Marini settled into the new lineup. Another founding member, Dick Halligan, also departed, replaced by jazz pianist Larry Willis (from the Cannonball Adderley Quintet), and Swedish guitarist Georg Wadenius, from the popular Swedish outfit Made in Sweden, joined as lead guitarist around the same time.  The new edition of Blood, Sweat & Tears released New Blood in September 1972, which found the group moving into a more overtly jazz-fusion repertoire. The album broke through the Top 40 chart (the last BS&T LP to do so) and spawned a single (\"So Long Dixie\", chart peak: 44) that received some airplay. Also included on the record was a cover version of Herbie Hancock's \"Maiden Voyage\", featuring the voice/guitar soloing of Georg Wadenius.  In mid-1973, Katz left to pursue a career as a producer (for Lou Reed and others). Winfield departed as well and was replaced by Tom Malone.  Blood, Sweat & Tears' next album, No Sweat (June 1973), continued in a jazz-fusion vein and featured intricate horn work. Tom Malone's stay in the band was brief and he left to make way for jazz trumpeter John Madrid. But Madrid's tenure was likewise short-lived and he never recorded with the band. Both Madrid and Soloff left in early 1974, making way for new horn player/arranger Tony Klatka on their next release, Mirror Image (July 1974), which also saw the addition of vocalist/saxophonist Jerry LaCroix (formerly of Edgar Winter's White Trash), sax player Bill Tillman, bassist Ron McClure and the exodus of original bass player Jim Fielder. This recording features the adoption of a sound pitched between Philly Soul and the mid-1970s albums by Herbie Hancock's Headhunters, along with aspirations to Chick Corea's jazz-fusion group Return to Forever.  Jerry LaCroix left BS&T to join Rare Earth after playing his final show with them at Wollman Rink in New York's Central Park on July 27, 1974.

Tocqueville believed that war and colonization would \"restore national pride, threatened\", he believed, by \"The gradual softening of social mores\" in the middle classes. Their taste for \"material pleasures\" was spreading to the whole of society, giving it \"an example of weakness and egotism\". Applauding the methods of General Bugeaud, Tocqueville went so far to claim that \"war in Africa is a science. Everyone is familiar with its rules and everyone can apply those rules with almost complete certainty of success. One of the greatest services that Field Marshal Bugeaud has rendered his country is to have spread, perfected and made everyone aware of this new science.\" Tocqueville advocated racial segregation in Algeria with two distinct legislations, one for European colonists and one for the Arab population. Such a two-tier arrangement would be fully realised with the 1870 Cremieux decree and the Indigenousness Code, which extended French citizenship to European settlers and Algerian Jews, whereas Muslim Algerians would be governed by Muslim law and restricted to a second-class citizenship. \n\nAccording to the above paragraph, the correct answer to the question \"What did Tocqueville advocate for that came into effect in 1870?\" is \"Racial segregation in Algeria\"?", "Question: Suggest a movie title for the following movie plot: In 2020, human boxers are replaced by robots.

Light-dark color variation is common in the mammalian taxa. Sometimes, this color variation is determined by age variation, however, in other cases, it is determined by other factors. Selective pressures, such as ecological interactions with other populations or environmental conditions, often lead to the variation in mammalian coloration. These selective pressures favor certain colors in order to increase survival. Camouflage is thought to be a major selection pressure shaping coloration in mammals, although there is also evidence that sexual selection, communication, and physiological processes may influence the evolution of coloration as well. Camouflage is the most predominant mechanism for color variation, as it aids in the concealment of the organisms from predators or from their prey. Coat color can also be for intraspecies communication such as warning members of their species about predators, indicating health for reproductive purposes, communicating between mother and young, and intimidating predators. Studies have shown that in some cases, differences in female and male coat color could indicate information nutrition and hormone levels, which are important in the mate selection process. One final mechanism for coat color variation is physiological response purposes, such as temperature regulation in tropical or arctic environments. Although much has been observed about color variation, much of the genetic that link coat color to genes is still unknown. The genetic sites where pigmentation genes are found are known to affect phenotype by: 1) altering the spatial distribution of pigmentation of the hairs, and 2) altering the density and distribution of the hairs. Quantitative trait mapping is being used to better understand the distribution of loci responsible for pigmentation variation.

Both countries are destroyed, as is most of the world. The submarine crew finds refuge in Melbourne, Australia, which the radioactive fallout has not yet reached (though radio communications with several radio operators farther north than Australia indicate that radiation has reached their countries and will be in Australia in a few months). Towers places his vessel under the command of the Royal Australian Navy and is summoned to attend a briefing. When Towers (Armand Assante), Australian scientist Julian Osborne (Bryan Brown) and Australian liaison officer Peter Holmes (Grant Bowler) find out there is an automated digital broadcast coming from Alaska in the Northern Hemisphere, the submarine is sent to investigate. En route, the submarine surfaces in San Francisco, where the Golden Gate Bridge has collapsed and the city shoreline is in ruins. A crew member who is from San Francisco abandons ship, planning on dying in his home city, and is left by his shipmates after it is argued that the length of time he has spent outside has already made him sick with radiation sickness. Upon reaching Alaska, Towers and his executive officer go ashore to find no survivors. Entering a house and seeing a dead family huddled on a bed, Towers thinks of his own family and what they must have gone through.

British troops remained stationed in Egypt until the signing of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty in 1936, under which it was agreed that the troops would withdraw but continue to occupy and defend the Suez Canal zone. In return, Egypt was assisted to join the League of Nations. Iraq, a British mandate since 1920, also gained membership of the League in its own right after achieving independence from Britain in 1932. In Palestine, Britain was presented with the problem of mediating between the Arab and Jewish communities. The 1917 Balfour Declaration, which had been incorporated into the terms of the mandate, stated that a national home for the Jewish people would be established in Palestine, and Jewish immigration allowed up to a limit that would be determined by the mandatory power. This led to increasing conflict with the Arab population, who openly revolted in 1936. As the threat of war with Germany increased during the 1930s, Britain judged the support of the Arab population in the Middle East as more important than the establishment of a Jewish homeland, and shifted to a pro-Arab stance, limiting Jewish immigration and in turn triggering a Jewish insurgency.\"  Answer:\nThe answer to this question is:", "Sentence 1: um yeah now they have to deal with whatever they get dished out more or less taken on from each side because they're getting it from like Turkey closed their borders\n\nSentence 2: Turkey closed their borders and they now have to deal with whatever they get dished out.\nIs this second sentence entailed by the first sentence?", "Answer the following question: Question: how big are baby zebras when born?

He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. \n  \n The entrance to the city has been closed. Security forces were combing the area for other suspicious packages or objects. \n  \n A Channel 2 reporter said that the Palestinian Red Crescent contacted the emergency services to offer assistance in evacuating the wounded. \n  \n The 59-year-old woman who was killed in the explosion was believed to be a foreign citizen, and her name was not cleared for publication since her family has yet to be notified. \n  \n The woman was seriously wounded as a result of the bombing, and rescue services transferred her to the emergency room in the Hadassah Ein Karem Hospital. Doctors fought for her life for about an hour and ultimately were forced to declare her dead. \n  \n Officials in the hospital said that until the late evening hours no family or friends came to look for the woman, and noted that several documents that she possessed indicated that she was a foreign citizen. \n  \n The bombing occurred just hours after Gaza militants fired two Grad-type Katyusha rocket at the southern city of Be'er Sheva and a barrage of mortar shells on the western Negev. \n  \n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu postponed his scheduled trip to Moscow in the wake of the Jerusalem bombing. \n  \n Jerusalem has been hit by a number of terror attacks over the last few years, two of them involving tractor drivers that ploughed down a central street. \n  \n In the first incident in July 2008, a bulldozer driver hit a bus, pedestrian and cars before he was neutralized by a soldier and civilian who mounted his vehicle and overtook him and then shot and killed him. \n  \n The second attack took place three weeks later. Twenty-four people were injured in the attack, one of which moderately to critically wounded. The terrorist hit five cars before he was shot by a civilian and an IDF military border guard officer that were at the scene of the attack. \n  \n  \n  \n Three months later, 19 people were injured - two of them critically and four moderately -when an East Jerusalem resident veered off the street onto the sidewalk near the Old City of Jerusalem and crashed into pedestrians. Most of the pedestrians were soldiers. An officer among the group open fire and killed the terrorist. \n  \n The capital suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004. \n  \n Emergency numbers: \n  \n Hadassah Hospital hotline: 1255122 \n  \n Sha'arei Zedek Hospital 1255125 \n  \n Jerusalem municipality: 02 5314600 ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC Israeli police are looking for one suspect \n  \n One person has died and more than 30 others are injured after a bomb blast at a crowded bus stop in Jerusalem. \n  \n The bomb had been left in a bag by the side of the road near the central bus station, police said. \n  \n Jerusalem suffered a spate of bus bombings by Palestinian militants between 2000 and 2004 but attacks had stopped in recent years. \n  \n Israel's prime minister said the country would act aggressively to restore security. \n  \n \"Israel will act aggressively, responsibly and wisely to preserve the quiet and security that prevailed here over the past two years,\" Benjamin Netanyahu said. \n  \n He said the attackers sought to test the country's will and determination and said the Israeli people had \"an iron will\" to defend their country. \n  \n Shattered windows \n  \n Witnesses said the force of the blast - just after 1500 local time (1300 GMT) - shook buildings over a wide area. \n  \n Dozens of ambulances converged on the scene near the entrance to the city, and police sealed off the area. \n  \n It is believed the bomb exploded as a bus pulled up at the stop, but it is not clear if passengers on the bus were among the casualties. \n  \n Israeli officials initially said no-one had been killed in the blast but later confirmed that a woman had died from her injuries. \n  \n At the scene The explosion happened right in the heart of west Jerusalem - a city that has, for many years, been relatively peaceful. The target was the No 74 bus - its windscreen blown out by the force of the blast. There was shrapnel damage everywhere. But, unlike previous incidents, police say this was not a suicide bombing and there is now an urgent man-hunt going on for someone who, according to police, left a device at the bus stop and then ran away. Dozens of paramedics and emergency vehicles were quickly at the scene - treating more than 30 wounded people. Such a bomb attack in Jerusalem may not have happened for many years, but it comes at a time of increased tension in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. Political leaders, Israeli and Palestinian, have condemned the upsurge in violence but many observers say these are tense moments and more violence may be inevitable. \n  \n A correspondent for AFP news agency at the scene said people were lying on the ground covered in blood and many cars and buses had shattered windows. \n  \n \"(We believe) the device weighed about 1-2kg (2-4lb),\" Internal Security Minister Yitzhak Aharonovitch told Israel's Channel 2 television. \n  \n \"It exploded in a small suitcase on the sidewalk next to the bus stop.\" \n  \n Motti Bukchin, a volunteer with the Israeli emergency service Zaka, said he and his colleagues were in a meeting nearby when they heard the blast. \n  \n \"When we arrived at the site of the attack we saw two women lying in huge pools of blood on the pavement. We began resuscitation immediately and were soon joined by other medical personnel. The two women were evacuated to hospital in serious to critical condition,\" he said. \n  \n Israeli police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told the BBC they were searching for a suspect and a vehicle believed to have been used in planting the bomb. \n  \n Medics said many of the injured had shrapnel wounds. \n  \n Three are seriously injured and five are in \"a moderate condition, while the rest are less badly hurt\", Uri Shacham, a senior paramedic told reporters. \n  \n After the attack, Prime Minister Netanyahu met defence and security officials, delaying by a few hours a scheduled trip to Moscow where he is due to hold talks with Russian President Dmitry Medvedev and Prime Minister Vladimir Putin. \n  \n 'Unacceptable' attack \n  \n Jerusalem was hit by a series of bombings - mostly targeting buses and restaurants - during the second Palestinian uprising that began in 2000. However the attacks have stopped in recent years. Jerusalem last experienced a bus bombing in 2004. \n  \n The latest attacks comes amid heightened tension in the Gaza Strip. \n  \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption US Foreign Secretary Hillary Clinton: \"Israel... has to respond when this occurs\" \n  \n The BBC's Jon Donnison in Gaza says none of the militant factions there has said it was involved in the Jerusalem attack. \n  \n But an Islamic Jihad leader said a Palestinian attack would be a \"natural response\" to this week's Israeli strikes in Gaza. \n  \n On Wednesday, Israeli warplanes launched fresh air strikes east of Gaza City, after Palestinian militants fired two rockets into southern Israel. \n  \n Islamic Jihad said it carried out the rocket attacks in reprisal for the killing of eight Palestinians near Gaza City on Tuesday. Four of those killed were members of one family and two of them were children. \n  \n Hamas government spokesman Taher Nono has refused to comment on the Jerusalem explosion. \n  \n Previous Jerusalem attacks July 2008: Three killed and more than 40 injured in bulldozer attack on Jaffa Street \n  \n Three killed and more than 40 injured in bulldozer attack on Jaffa Street March 2008: Eight students killed when gunman opens fire at religious school in west of city \n  \n Eight students killed when gunman opens fire at religious school in west of city February 2004: Eight killed and dozens hurt in suicide blast on bus, West Jerusalem \n  \n Eight killed and dozens hurt in suicide blast on bus, West Jerusalem January 2004: At least 10 killed in suicide bombing on bus in West Jerusalem \n  \n At least 10 killed in suicide bombing on bus in West Jerusalem Aug 2003: 20 people, including children, killed in suicide bus blast in ultra-Orthodox area of Shmuel Hanavi \n  \n However, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the bombing, calling it \"a terrorist attack\". \n  \n US President Barack Obama condemned the Jerusalem attack \"as well as the rockets and mortars fired from Gaza in recent days\". \n  \n \"We stress the importance of calm and urge all parties to do everything in their power to prevent further violence and civilian casualties,\" he said. \n  \n Condemnation also came from UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon who said \"such attacks are unacceptable\". \n  \n The Mayor of Jerusalem, Nir Barkat, called on the public to be alert but to \"return to regular routines as quickly as possible\". \n  \n \"When terror attempts to disrupt our way of life, the best solution is to get back to normal as quickly as possible. Events in Jerusalem will not be cancelled and Jerusalem will not stop running,\" he said. \n  \n UK Foreign Secretary William Hague described the attack as \"shocking and deeply distressing\". ||||| A bomb struck a crowded bus stop in central Jerusalem Wednesday, killing one woman and wounding more than 20 other people in what authorities said was the first major Palestinian militant attack in the city in several years. \n  \n Israel Rescue workers and paramedics work next to a pool of blood following an explosion at a bus stop in Jerusalem, Wednesday, March 23, 2011.

A bomb exploded near a crowded bus, wounding at... (Associated Press) \n  \n The bombing brought back memories of the second Palestinian uprising last decade, a period in which hundreds of Israelis were killed by suicide bombings in Jerusalem and other major cities. \n  \n There was no immediate claim of responsibility, but Israeli police blamed Palestinian militants. The attack came against the backdrop of a rising wave of violence that has threatened to upset more than two years of relative calm that has prevailed since an Israeli offensive in the Gaza Strip. \n  \n Earlier this month, five members of a Jewish settler family were knifed to death in their sleep at their West Bank home. And in recent days, Israel has carried out reprisals in Gaza in retaliation for rocket and mortar fire launched into southern Israel. On Tuesday, an errant Israeli strike meant for Palestinian militants killed four members of a Palestinian family in Gaza. \n  \n Adding to the tensions, peace efforts with Hamas' rival, the Western-backed Palestinian government in the West Bank, have been stalled for months. Palestinian leaders condemned the attack. \n  \n Israel's Defense Minister Ehud Barak hinted that Israel would retaliate against Hamas, the militant group that rules Gaza. At least three rockets landed in the southern city of Beersheba on Monday, and mortar shells were landing in southern Israel late in the afternoon. \n  \n \"We will not tolerate the harming of Israeli citizens, not in the south and not in Jerusalem,\" Barak said. \"Hamas is responsible for the firing of rockets toward Beersheba today and this responsibility has a price.\" \n  \n The 3 p.m. bombing occurred near the main entrance to Jerusalem, next to the city's central bus station and main convention center, an area that is crowded with travelers and passers-by. The bomb went off next to the a food stand ironically called, in a Hebrew play on words, \"a blast of a kiosk.\" \n  \n The blast reverberated throughout Jerusalem and blew out the windows of two crowded buses. Rescuers removed bloodied people from the area on stretchers, as sirens from speeding ambulances wailed in the background. \n  \n \"We are talking about a terror attack,\" said police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld. \n  \n He said a 60-year-old woman died from her wounds. Israel's national rescue service said some 24 others were wounded, including three in critical condition. \n  \n Jerusalem's police chief, Aharon Franco, said that the bomb was about four pounds (one to two kilograms) and was planted in a small bag on the sidewalk. He said security services were on alert for additional attacks. \n  \n He said authorities had no firm leads but were investigating a possible link to a small bombing earlier this month that wounded a garbage collector as he removed the device from a trash can. \n  \n \"I saw kids crying on the street, lying in blood on the side of the road,\" said one man who witnessed the blast. Crying on the telephone, he frantically tried to reach his daughter, calming down a bit when he found out she was safe. The man, trembling in shock, refused to give his name. \n  \n Radio and TV stations posted emergency numbers for concerned citizens to inquire about relatives. \n  \n Meir Hagid, one of the bus drivers, said he heard a loud explosion as he drove by the site, located near the main entrance to Jerusalem and its central bus station. \n  \n \"I heard the explosion in the bus stop,\" he said. He halted his vehicle and people got off. He said nobody in his bus was hurt. \n  \n Samuel Conik, 20, said he ran to the scene when he heard the explosion and saw fire coming out of a phone booth. Nearby was a badly burned man with bloody legs and his skin peeling off. \n  \n At the scene, a group of ultra-Orthodox Jews began chanting \"Death to Arabs.\" \n  \n Eli Yishai, Israel's interior minister, rushed to the scene and called for swift Israeli retaliation. \"With these murderers, these terror organizations ... we must act, or we will lose our deterrence,\" he told Channel 2 TV. \n  \n Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's office said the Israeli leader had decided to delay a planned trip to Moscow for several hours to deal with the crisis. \n  \n Police, accompanied by sniffer dogs, broke into cars near the site to search for evidence and possible additional explosives. \n  \n The Palestinians are divided between two rival governments, the Hamas regime in Gaza and the Western-backed Palestinian Authority in the West Bank. The West Bank government seeks peace with Israel, though talks broke down last September. \n  \n In the West Bank town of Ramallah, Palestinian Prime Minister Salam Fayyad condemned the bombing \"in the strongest terms.\" His boss, President Mahmoud Abbas, who was traveling in Russia, issued a similar condemnation through his office. \n  \n In the Gaza Strip, the Islamic Jihad militant group, which has carried out dozens of attacks, said it was not connected to the blast. But spokesman Khader Habib said the group \"applauds all efforts to respond to the crimes committed daily against our people.\" \n  \n Jerusalem suffered dozens of suicide bombings that targeted buses and restaurants during the second Palestinian uprising last decade. But the attacks have halted in recent years. Jerusalem last experienced a suicide bombing in 2004, and the last suicide bombing in Israel occurred in 2008 in the southern town of Dimona. \n  \n Even so, the city has experienced other deadly violence. In early 2008, eight students at a Jerusalem seminary were killed when Palestinian gunmen entered the school and opened fire. \n  \n Palestinians also carried out several attacks with construction vehicles against Jerusalem in the past few years that ended with fatalities when the drivers rammed their vehicles into bystanders. |||||\nWhat is a summary?", "Question: Read the passage below and choose the right answer to the following question (choices are increases it or decreases it ):  The full box is harder to move because it has greater mass and therefore greater inertia.

After the ignored US ultimatum to the Soviets results in a brief tactical nuclear skirmish, Britain is gripped by fear, with looting and rioting erupting. \"Known subversives\" (including peace activists and some trade unionists) are arrested and interned under the Emergency Powers Act.

At 8:30\u00c2\u00a0a.m. GMT (3:30 in Washington, suggesting the Soviets fire first) on 26 May, the town hall office transmitter signals Attack Warning Red, and Sheffield's air raid sirens sound. Panic breaks out in the city and the Sheffield operations staff man their desks. At 8:35\u00c2\u00a0a.m. a single nuclear warhead air bursts high over the North Sea, producing an electromagnetic pulse which damages or destroys communications and most electrical systems throughout the UK and northwestern Europe. Two minutes later the first missile salvos hit NATO targets, including nearby RAF Finningley 18 miles (29\u00c2\u00a0km) from Sheffield. Although the city is not yet heavily damaged, the mushroom cloud from Finningley is clearly visible and chaos reigns in the streets, with Jimmy last seen running from his stalled truck in an attempt to reach Ruth. Sheffield is soon hit by a one megaton warhead launched at the Tinsley Viaduct. A title card states that strategic targets, including steel and chemical factories in the Midlands, are the primary targets, with two-thirds of all UK homes destroyed and immediate deaths ranging between 17 and 30 million.

As a result, the ice and the snow are melting at record-setting rates. One result is that sea levels are rising around the world, putting animals and people at risk. A sheet of ice acts like a huge mirror, reflecting the sun's energy. But ocean water, which is darker than ice, absorbs a lot of it. This causes the ocean to warm, which in turn speeds up ice melting and which leads to even more open waters. The cycle continues until all the ice is gone. \"As the ice melts, water flows into the oceans, making them less salty. That, along with warmer water temperatures, can harm the creatures that live in, under, and near the ice,\" says zoologist Michael Stoddard. \"Cold-adapted animals -- including polar bears, foxes, hares, and seals -- also need ice for travel and survival.\" \"Most species of fish, sea spiders, and many other animals and plants that live in the waters of Antarctica don't live anywhere else,\" Stoddard says. \"Many of them have special proteins in their bodies keeping them from freezing to death and have other adaptation to the cold that has yet to be explored.\" Therefore, experts are urging us to reconsider the way we live. The fuels that we burn in cars, power stations, and factories are largely to blame for the carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases that are trapping overmuch heat in our atmosphere. If we can produce fewer of these gases, we can help save the polar ice. \"Even small things would make a difference, if everyone did them.\" Michael Stoddard says, \"That's what we have to figure out in the near future to help save the polar ice and thus protect the oceans and us.\" Question: From the passage, we can know that   _  .

Tan Zhenlin (term 1949-1952), the inaugural Party Secretary, was one of the leading voices against Mao's Cultural Revolution during the so-called February Countercurrent of 1967. Jiang Hua (term 1956-1968), was the \"chief justice\" on the Special Court in the case against the Gang of Four in 1980. Three provincial Party Secretaries since the 1990s have gone onto prominence at the national level. They include CPC General Secretary and President Xi Jinping (term 2002-2007), National People's Congress Chairman and former Vice-Premier Zhang Dejiang (term 1998-2002), and Zhao Hongzhu (term 2007-2012), the Deputy Secretary of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, China's top anti-corruption body. Of Zhejiang's fourteen Party Secretaries since 1949, none were native to the province.

The film begins with the couple's wedding, and the audience learns that they are planning to leave their apartment in Brooklyn for Japan, where Ben has been hired to take pictures for a particular client. The couple has made the decision to leave for Japan a few days early, renting a cabin so they can enjoy a shorter honeymoon. In the car on the way to the cabin, Jane gets lost and asks a sleeping Ben to check the map. While attempting to get their bearings, Jane sees a girl walk into the road. She hits the girl, and swerves off the road, crashing the car into a tree. They both fall unconscious. When she awakens, Jane realizes the girl could very well still be laying in the road, and rushes out of the car to find her, Ben on her heels. They find nothing, and Ben thinks that the girl was already found and has gotten the medical help that she would need. He also thinks the injuries weren't life-threatening, as they cannot find any blood or evidence of a collision and wants to call for help. Later, help does arrive for them, and they are able to continue with their travel to the cabin, but Jane is haunted by the image of the girl. Ben's shoulder is bothering him, since the accident. Jane tells him he needs to get it checked out. Ben chooses to ignore it, and at the cabin, they are able to enjoy a few day long honeymoon, and Ben wants to take pictures to record the event.Days later, Ben has to report for work with his friend Bruno (David Denman) Jane accompanies him but is somewhat left to her own devices as Ben needs to meet with the clients right away.

We are using the same products. So absolutely it's a trade barrier,\u201d Unrau told CBC News.\n\nTyson is the third-biggest buyer of Canadian cattle and bought about 150,000 head last year.\n\n\"Other American buyers certainly could follow suit, and that's a real concern for us,\" said Agriculture Minister Gerry Ritz, adding that the Tyson decision shows Canada has to diversify and find new markets.\n\n\"We have a 70 per cent reliance on the Americans for processing and for purchasing livestock. We need to move away from that, and, of course, by moving product now into the European theatre, just as soon as we get [the Canada-European Union free trade deal] ratified, certainly is the right way to go.\"\n\nCanada is challenging the U.S. country-of-origin meat labelling policy with the World Trade Organization and in the U.S. courts.\n\nThe regulations track beef and pork through the meat processing and distribution systems and require labels that state where animals are born, where they are slaughtered and where they are packed.\n\nLabels would include such information as \"born, raised and slaughtered in the United States\" for American meat. Cuts of meat from other countries could carry labels such as \"born in Canada, raised and slaughtered in the United States.\"\n\nTyson said it is disappointed with the U.S. rules that require labels on meat products to contain detailed information about where the products come from. It also means that meat coming from different countries has to be segregated in a warehouse and labelled differently, increasing costs for the meat packers.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we don't have enough warehousing capacity to accommodate the proliferation of products requiring different types of labels due to this regulation,\" Tyson spokesman Worth Sparkman wrote in an email.\n\n\"As a result, we have discontinued buying cattle shipped to our U.S. beef plants directly from Canada effective mid-October.\"\n\nSparkman said Tyson would continue buying Canadian calves for U.S. feedlots.\n\nCattle shipments to the U.S. were cut in half in the first year after the U.S. proposed country-of-origin labelling in 2008. There was a 58 per cent drop in slaughter hog exports.\n\nIn November, the rules become even more stringent. The Tyson decision worries Canadian feedlot operators.\n\n\u201cI wouldn't' say it's a death knell but it's a further strain on our industry at a time when we were looking for some relief,\u201d said Ben Thorlakson, who owns a feed yard near Airdrie, Alta.\n\n\u201cWe have one fewer buyer and we only had five to start with \u2026 so it's just reduced the overall demand for our cattle \u2026 and therefore the prices are lower, but that's an overall effect of this country-of-origin labelling initiative.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian Cattlemen's Association is part of a coalition that is in the process of appealing a U.S. court ruling last month. That ruling rejected a request for an injunction against the latest version of the U.S. label policy, which is to go into effect in November.\n\nThe coalition argues the policy would be costly and offer no food safety or public health benefit.\n\nSummary:", "Kardashian was born on October 21, 1980 in Los Angeles, California, the daughter of Robert and Kris (nee Houghton).

When Victor climbs onto the ledge outside his window, Trabucco convinces him not to jump by agreeing to drive him to the Institute for Sexual Fulfillment, the nearby clinic where Victor's wife Celia, a researcher for 60 Minutes, is gathering information for a segment on the program. At the clinic, Victor discovers Celia has fallen in love with Dr. Zuckerbrot, who is concerned her husband's suicide will reflect badly on his practice.

Among her admirers is former First Lady Nancy Reagan, the widow of President Ronald Reagan - who worked closely with the so-called Iron Lady. Reagan and Thatcher joined forces in the early 1980s and drastically changed the economic and political landscapes in both of their countries. Scroll down for video. 'Special relationship': Former First Lady Nancy Reagan (seen here in 1991) said she was too frail to attend Mrs Thatcher's funeral but she mourned her loss. Their calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. And their side-by-side standing up to. Soviet communism is credited by those of all political stripes as. hastening the end of the Cold War. Dynamic duo: Reagan and Thatcher's calls for more-austere government and lower taxes still resonate with conservatives on both sides of the Atlantic. Speaking to MSNBC's Andrea Mitchell yesterday, Mrs Reagan said that it wasn't just her husband who got along well with Mrs Thatcher, but she did as well. 'We had a very special relationship,' Mrs Reagan said via phone. 'I think people thought she and I didn't have a relationship. Nothing could be farther from the truth. And of course I loved it that she and Ronnie were as close as they were.' Also singing Thatcher's praises was President Barack Obama, who said that America 'has lost a true friend.' The kind words came amid the revelation that Thatcher died in the luxury suite at the Ritz where she had spent months recuperating after an operation. Britain's first and only female prime minister, who passed away peacefully at the age of 87 after suffering a massive stroke, had checked into the five star hotel at the start of the year following minor surgery on her bladder over Christmas. While a close-knit circle of friends. took it in turns to visit the increasingly frail 87-year-old at the. Belgravia hotel - a long-time favorite of the former leader's - it was a. solitary start to what would prove to be her final few months. She had been due to spend Christmas Day. with her niece Jane Mays, who lives in north east London, but was. admitted to hospital five days earlier for minor surgery to remove a. growth on her bladder. Iron Lady: Baroness Thatcher, who died today, was pictured on a bench in Battersea Park, London with her carers and a police officer. Ritz: Media and police were gathered outside the five star Ritz Hotel in London today, where Baroness Thatcher died after suffering a massive stroke. Her daughter Carol Thatcher, 59, was understood to be at her side in the hospital at Christmas time. After being discharged Baroness Thatcher was checked straight into a suite at the hotel in Belgravia amid concerns she would no longer be able to manage the stairs at her elegant four-story mansion. Staff at the hotel had invited her to make the Ritz her home for the foreseeable future, and her carers are understood to have been taking it in turns to stay with the 87-year-old. Yesterday Carol dashed home from Swiss ski resort Klosters, where she lives for part of the year, to be with her ailing mother, her neighbours said. The mother of two, who was Britain's. first and only female prime minister, had spent the previous two. Christmases without either Carol or her twin brother Sir Mark. Close. friends of the former prime minister said after she was discharged that. she was in 'sparkling form' following the procedure, but admitted the. experience had been 'very draining' for her. Home life: The former prime minister had spent recent Christmases without her children Carol (pictured with her mother) and Mark. The spell in hospital followed more than a decade of fragile health for Baroness Thatcher after she suffered a series of minor strokes in 2002. She had been suffering from acute short-term memory loss, which could make social gatherings an unsettling experience, and in recent years the once formidable Iron Lady had all but disappeared from public view. Alongside her health issues, in 2003 Baroness Thatcher suffered the devastating loss of her husband Denis, 88, who she had described as the 'golden thread running through my life.' The life-altering loss heralded the. start of a new chapter in her life, one in which she appeared to spend. increasing periods of time without her close family around her. Loved ones: Family was said to be essential in the life of Baroness Thatcher, who was mother to Carol, left, who rushed home from a ski trip in Klosters, Switzerland, yesterday, and Sir Mark, right. 'Golden thread': Baroness Thatcher's husband Denis died in 2003 at the age of 88 after suffering heart problems and pancreatic cancer. Although she was a mother of two, it was. with Mrs Mayes - the daughter of Baroness Thatcher's late older sister. Muriel - that she had been due to spend last Christmas before she fell. ill. She dined with Mrs Mayes and her family on Christmas Day 2011, while both Carol and Mark spent the festive season abroad. The former prime minister had credited her husband, who was 10 years her senior, as the man 'who has made everything possible.' Honoured: Baroness Thatcher will receive a ceremonial funeral with military honours, Downing Street has said. She met her husband while fighting the Dartford constituency - which she lost - in 1950. Denis, the director of a paint firm, helped the fledgeling politician by driving her around. They married in the autumn of 1951 when Baroness Thatcher was 26. As she went on to embark upon a career at the highest echelons of British politics, she relied on Denis as a constant source of discreet support. The pair had enjoyed an marriage lasting more than 50 years, but Baroness Thatcher's family life was not without moments of crisis. Some months after the death of her. husband she endured a second personal trauma when their son, Sir Mark,. was charged in August 2004 with plotting a coup to overthrow the. Government of oil-rich Equatorial Guinea - a charge which could, in its. extreme, have led to the death penalty. Baroness Thatcher, already suffering ill health, was deeply upset by the news about her son, to whom she was devoted. To her intense relief, he entered a guilty plea and was punished with a large fine and a suspended prison sentence. Baroness Thatcher was well enough to. celebrate her 87th birthday with Sir Mark, 59, and his wife at a London. restaurant last October. She had also enjoyed robust health during her term as Prime Minister. Unlike. her predecessor at 10 Downing Street, James Callaghan, Mrs Thatcher did. not have a doctor accompanying her on foreign trips. Days gone by: The then Conservative Party leader is seen strolling through the grounds of Scotney Castle in Kent with husband Denis and their twins Mark and Carol in 1979. Upsetting: Sir Mark is seen outside the High Court in Cape Town in 2004, after pleading guilty to charges of plotting a coup to overthrow the government of Equatorial Guinea. Once, when she was asked by Lee Kuan Yew, who was prime minister of Singapore, why she did not travel with a doctor, she replied: 'I would have ended up looking after the doctor'. But in the past decade, she had become increasing frail. In 2002, she made her first concession to increasing age when she cut back her workload on the advice of doctors. Concern about her health had been growing and it emerged she had suffered a minor stroke shortly before New Year 2002 during her golden wedding anniversary holiday with Sir Denis Thatcher in Madeira. The series of minor strokes forced her to retire from public speaking. Despite this, in May 2004 - the 25th anniversary of her election as Prime Minister - she defied doctors' orders to speak at a dinner held in her honour, attacking the Blair Government and praising Michael Howard, then Tory leader. In 2008, Lady Thatcher succumbed to the heat at a dinner in the House of Lords and fainted. She was taken to nearby St Thomas's Hospital for tests, but was allowed to go home the following day. Recuperation: Baroness Thatcher started the year convalescing at the Ritz in central London after undergoing minor surgery over Christmas. Tributes: Notes and bouquets were piling up outside the former prime minister's home in London following the news of her death today. That year her daughter Carol admitted that her mother suffered from dementia. She said she first noticed her mother's previously formidable memory was failing in 2000 and she had to be repeatedly. reminded about the death of her husband, each time reacting to the sad. news as if it were the first time she had heard it. Baroness Thatcher died after. suffering from a stroke - a condition which kills around 45,000 people. every year in the UK - and is the third largest cause of death, after. heart disease and cancer. The risk of stroke rises. significantly with age. And 40,000 of those who die each year are over. the age of 75, according to the Stroke Association. Although men have a higher risk of stroke, women are one and a half times as likely to die from one.\n\nWrite highlights for this article.", "\n\nI heard that Riley looked forward to Kendall getting home from work that day.

Typically, a sausage is formed in a casing traditionally made from intestine, but sometimes from synthetic materials. Sausages that are sold uncooked are usually cooked in many ways, including pan-frying, broiling and barbecuing. Some sausages are cooked during processing and the casing may then be removed.  - The Beatles were an English rock band, formed in Liverpool in 1960. With members John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison and Ringo Starr, they became widely regarded as the foremost and most influential act of the rock era. Rooted in skiffle, beat, and 1950s rock and roll, the Beatles later experimented with several musical styles, ranging from pop ballads and Indian music to psychedelia and hard rock, often incorporating classical elements and unconventional recording techniques in innovative ways. In the early 1960s, their enormous popularity first emerged as \"Beatlemania\", but as the group's music grew in sophistication, led by primary songwriters Lennon and McCartney, they came to be perceived as an embodiment of the ideals shared by the counterculture of the 1960s.  - Porridge (also spelled porage, porrige, parritch) is a dish made by boiling ground, crushed, or chopped starchy plants  typically grain  in water or milk.

The term spam in the context of electronic communications is derived from this sketch .  - The term cult usually refers to a social group defined by their religious, spiritual, or philosophical beliefs, or common interest in a particular personality, object or goal. The term itself is controversial and has divergent definitions in popular culture and in academia and has been an ongoing source of contention among scholars across several fields of study. In the sociological classifications of religious movements, a cult is a social group with socially deviant or novel beliefs and practices, although this is often unclear. Other researchers present a less-organized picture of cults on the basis that cults arise spontaneously around novel beliefs and practices. The word \"cult\" has always been controversial because it is (in a pejorative sense) considered a subjective term, used as an \"ad hominem\" attack against groups with differing doctrines or practices. Cults range in size from local groups with a few members to international organizations with millions.  - Monty Pythons Flying Circus (known during the final series as just Monty Python) is a British sketch comedy series created by the comedy group Monty Python and broadcast by the BBC from 1969 to 1974.

The most widely used system for classifying carcinogens comes from the IARC, which places them into five groups. Group 1 carcinogens definitely cause cancer in humans. Group 2A is probably carcinogenic to humans, Group 2B is possibly carcinogenic, the carcinogenicity of Group 3 in humans is unclassifiable, and Group 4 is probably not carcinogenic to humans. Only a little more than 100 are classified as Group 1 cancer-causing substances, including ultraviolet radiation and tobacco smoke. \"Our task was to evaluate the air everyone breathes rather than focus on specific air pollutants,\" the lARC's Dana Loomis said in a statement. \"The results from the reviewed studies point in the same direction: the risk of developing lung cancer is significantly increased in people exposed to air pollution.\" In 2010, lung cancer resulting from air pollution killed 223,000 people worldwide, and there was also convincing evidence that it increases the risk of bladder   cancer, according to the IARC.

Common sense holds that gossip hurts people's feelings and damages relationships.But recent research shows the opposite--that strong communities and relationships between people would be impossible without gossip. Gossip is a way for people to let you know the limits of social behavior.\"If you move into a community and your neighbor tells you how the former homeowner never dealt with his rubbish properly,his gossip is letting you in on something,\"says Dr.Ralph Rosnow of Temple University.\"Gossip says:these are the boundaries and you are crossing them.You're not _ the rules and you'd better get back in line.\" Seen this way,gossip is a way to communicate criticism without conflict ,giving you a chance to change your behavior without losing face. On the other hand,what about ill-willed gossip,the kind that puts other people down? Gossip is hearing something we like about someone we don't and,in nearly every country in the world,gossip magazines have huge numbers of readers.According to researchers,however,this kind of gossip also has a good side because it helps us put our own problems in perspective .\"If we read bad news about well-known people,or get the frightful details of our neighbors' bad situation over a cup of coffee,our own problems begin to pale in comparison ,\"says Dr.Jack Levin of Northeastern University. However,that doesn't mean that gossip is necessarily a good thing,either.Researchers found that people who gossip a lot tend to feel like they're under a lot of stress.This might be because while they're busy talking about other people,they're also busy thinking what other people are saying about them.

He and Stannie set out to get the money for the mortgage from their boss, the Toymaker (William Burress). But Stannie has mixed up an order from Santa Claus (building 100 wooden soldiers at six feet tall, instead of 600 soldiers at one foot tall) and one of the soldiers, when activated, wrecks the toy shop. Stannie and Ollie are fired without getting the money. The two then hatch a plan to sneak into Barnaby's house and steal the mortgage, but are again foiled by their incompetence. Barnaby has them arrested on a burglary charge, and the two are sentenced to be dunked in the ducking stool and then banished to Bogeyland. But Barnaby agrees to drop the charges if Bo Peep will marry him. She reluctantly agrees, but not before Ollie suffers the dunking. Stannie and Ollie come up with a new scheme.

Which continent had fewer birds with bigger beaks that survived?  Hint: A period of very low rainfall occurred while the Grants were on the islands. The drought resulted in fewer seeds for the finches to eat. Birds with smaller beaks could eat only the smaller seeds. Birds with bigger beaks were better off. They could eat seeds of all sizes. Therefore, there was more food available to them. Many of the small-beaked birds died in the drought. More of the big-beaked birds survived and reproduced.

They not only know the scales, songs, and chords that you need to practice, but they can give you specific advice on how to improve your playing. Make sure you like the teacher to a fixed term.

Purchase a book, watch videos online, get a music learning app or ask your teacher to help you learn so that you can play any music you can get your hands on. Practice reading music each day so that it becomes second nature. You can try to play pieces by sight, bring charts with you on the bus, play songs frequently or play musical games online. Music is built on a set of rules and relationships between notes, and knowing music theory allows you to see the patterns in your favorite songs and learn them more quickly. You can always take a course, but there are also a variety of books and online tutorials meant to teach people music theory, from the basics to complex arrangements. Available at every music store, these books are relatively cheap glossaries of every piano chord you could play. They are usually grouped together by note, but frequently they come with sections detailing which chords sound good together and the right scale to play for each note.\n\nSummary:", "Multi-select problem: How does the next paragraph end?\n\nHow to fix broken trust \nDecide when to apologize. \nDepending on what you've done wrong, you may be tempted to delay apologizing, apologize too soon, or apologize too much. Apologies that are not delayed tend to ease tension in the relationship and help with further conversation.\n\nPossible answers:\n (A). Recognize that you are probably partly partly responsible for what you did. If you can, try to answer any mistakes that a trusted person makes as a result of going behind your back.;\n (B). You may also consider apologizing according to your plan of action. You may tell your boyfriend that you hope that he'll allow you to have your mind set off before you start apologizing to him, or that you wish you had explained why you lied.;\n (C). Apologies for more significant events, like infidelity, are best when the person has had some time to fully process the event. If you are a woman, keep in mind the tendency in our culture for women to apologize too frequently.;\n (D). But many can't change trust issues completely.

Just South of Vancouver, in the quaint Historic fishing village of Steveston we hopped aboard our boat, and spent the day on the water cruising the coast looking for whales, other marine mammals and seabirds. The regular chug-chug-chug of the boat motor for a couple of hours lulled me into a meditate state as we sped our way over the State line from Vancouver, back down to the waters of Washington State. The shimmer of the water all dappled in the sunlight, the slow, measured tones of our guide and snuggling into my warm jacket against the sharp breeze off the coast was just enough to make me forget my worries, and zone out from all of my modern day dilemmas. Honestly, it needs to be prescribed on the NHS. Forget hauling yoga mats and sitting in sweaty concrete rooms with patterns trying to hide the utilitarian backdrop, just hop on a boat out from Vancouver. Not having much success closer to the British Columbia shores, our captain decided to head south past the Canadian/American border. Incredibly, the resident killer whales of the San Juan Islands are the most studied whales in the world; they, in turn, have observed humans for at least six thousand years. Stable family groups, called pods, represent several generations and include grandmothers (the pod leaders), adolescents, infants, and huge bulls. Each family member is recognized by its distinctive markings and can live as long as a human. Much of what is known about the orca whale\u2019s highly-organized social life has been learned from the resident pods in the San Juan Islands of Washington. Question: What land mass are the killer whales nearest? Options:  A. not enough information  B. San Juan Islands  C. Fishing village of Steveston  D.

Its parent company began in 1996 as a competitor to CART known as the Indy Racing League (IRL) which was created by then Indianapolis Motor Speedway owner Tony George. In 2008, the IndyCar Series merged with the Champ Car World Series (formerly CART). The series is sanctioned by INDYCAR.  - Memorial Day is a federal holiday in the United States for remembering the people who died while serving in the country's armed forces. The holiday, which is observed every year on the last Monday of May, originated as Decoration Day after the American Civil War in 1868, when the Grand Army of the Republic, an organization of Union veterans founded in Decatur, Illinois, established it as a time for the nation to decorate the graves of the Union war dead with flowers. By the 20th century, competing Union and Confederate holiday traditions, celebrated on different days, had merged, and Memorial Day eventually extended to honor all Americans who died while in the military service. It marks the start of the unofficial summer vacation season, while Labor Day marks its end.  - Michael \"Mike\" Lanigan is an entrepreneur and IndyCar Series team owner.  - Buddy Rice (born January 31, 1976) is an American racecar driver.

In most English-speaking regions, suburban areas are defined in contrast to central or inner city areas, but in Australian English and South African English, \"suburb\" has become largely synonymous with what is called a \"neighborhood\" in other countries and the term extends to inner city areas. In some areas, such as Australia, China, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and a few U.S. states, new suburbs are routinely annexed by adjacent cities. In others, such as Arabia, Canada, France, and much of the United States, many suburbs remain separate municipalities or are governed as part of a larger local government area such as a county.  - Rahal Letterman Lanigan Racing is an auto racing team that currently races in the United SportsCar Championship and the IndyCar Series. Based in Hilliard, Ohio, it is co-owned by 1986 Indianapolis 500 winner Bobby Rahal, former television talk show host David Letterman, and businessman Mike Lanigan.  - Robert \"Bobby\" Woodward Rahal (born January 10, 1953 in Medina, Ohio) is an American auto racing driver and team owner. As a driver, he won three championships and 24 races in the CART open-wheel series, including the 1986 Indianapolis 500. He also won the 2004 Indianapolis 500 as a team owner for the winning driver, Buddy Rice.  - The Indianapolis 500 is an automobile race held annually at Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana, an enclave suburb of Indianapolis, Indiana. The event is held over Memorial Day (originally Decoration Day) weekend, which is typically the last weekend in May. It is contested as part of the Verizon IndyCar Series, the top level of American Championship Car racing, an open-wheel formula colloquially known as \"Indy Car Racing\". The name of the race is often shortened to Indy 500.  - The 70th Indianapolis 500 was held at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway in Speedway, Indiana on Saturday, May 31, 1986. After being rained out on May 2526, the race was rescheduled for the following weekend.

He was also formerly on the Board of Directors of both entities. He founded the Indy Racing League and co-owned Vision Racing. Many commentators, such as Gordon Kirby, suggest that George's actions at the head of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and in creating the IRL to rival the then-dominant CART led to a sharp decline in popularity of open-wheel racing in the United States as it split the fanbase, and gave a significant boost to the national popularity of NASCAR.  - Graham Robert Rahal ( born January 4 , 1989 ) is an American race car driver .

At the first opportunity, he sneaks out of the refugee camp and goes into the city. When he spots a policeman, Hans panics and reacts by fleeing. The policeman chases him down and begins questioning him. Hans becomes very agitated and attacks, leaving the man unconscious in the street.

Meanwhile, police detective Karni sets out to track the fugitive down. On their journey, Josh is injured when he wanders into a minefield. He is taken to a hospital at a nearby kibbutz, but has only broken his leg. While Josh recovers, Hans becomes acquainted with one of the residents, Ya'el (Milly Vitale). They are attracted to each other, but he at first strongly resists her attempt to persuade him to remain at the kibbutz. He reveals to her that he had ignored warnings from friends to flee Nazi Germany before it was too late, making the fatal mistake of counting on his fame and popularity to protect his family.

Premiered on 21 November 1937 in Leningrad, it was a phenomenal success. The Fifth brought many to tears and welling emotions. Later, Shostakovich's purported memoir, Testimony, stated: \"I'll never believe that a man who understood nothing could feel the Fifth Symphony. Of course they understood, they understood what was happening around them and they understood what the Fifth was about.\"The success put Shostakovich in good standing once again. Music critics and the authorities alike, including those who had earlier accused Shostakovich of formalism, claimed that he had learned from his mistakes and become a true Soviet artist. In a newspaper article published under Shostakovich's name, the Fifth Symphony was characterized as \"A Soviet artist's creative response to just criticism.\" The composer Dmitry Kabalevsky, who had been among those who disassociated themselves from Shostakovich when the Pravda article was published, praised the Fifth Symphony and congratulated Shostakovich for \"not having given in to the seductive temptations of his previous 'erroneous' ways.\"It was also at this time that Shostakovich composed the first of his string quartets.

From Easy Street (1917) to Modern Times (1936), he made many of the funniest and most popular films of his time. He is best known for his character \"the little tramp  \". It is this kind-hearted character that we connect with the time of silent movies.      Born in London in 1889, Chaplin first visited America with a theater company in 1907. Appearing as Billy in the play Sherlock Holmes, the young Chaplin toured the country twice. On his second tour, he met Mack Sennett and was signed to Keystone Studios to act in films. In 1914, Chaplin made his first short film, Making a Living. That same year, he made thirty-four more short films. These early silent shorts allowed very little time for anything but physical comedy, and Chaplin was extremely good at it.     Chaplin was known as one of the most demanding men in Hollywood. No matter how big or tiny the size of the part, Chaplin walked each actor through every scene. Chaplin knew that a successful scene wasn't simply about the star, but about everyone on the screen. He required that all the actors and actresses work together in every performance. The only way to achieve it was to keep complete control over every scene. As he became more popular, he used more and more creative and difficult filming techniques. Movies such as his 1925 hit, The Gold Rush, required endless reworking of scenes and rebuilding of sets.      Though Chaplin is of the silent movie era, his achievements were carried over into the films of today. His strictness and concern for the processes of acting and directing made his films great and led the way to a new and more wonderful cinema. Chaplin's working life in entertainment lasted over 75 years, from the Victorian stage and the music hall in the United Kingdom as a child performer, until close to his death at the age of 88.\nThe answer to this question is:", "Here's a complex question that requires someone to reason about the input, can you answer it?

They travel to Haven where Katherine meets Loren and has a vision of her turning the river red. Meanwhile, Ben witnesses dead frogs seemingly fall from the sky.

In 1987, Dylan starred in Richard Marquand's movie Hearts of Fire, in which he played Billy Parker, a washed-up rock star turned chicken farmer whose teenage lover (Fiona) leaves him for a jaded English synth-pop sensation played by Rupert Everett. Dylan also contributed two original songs to the soundtrack\u2014\"Night After Night\", and \"I Had a Dream About You, Baby\", as well as a cover of John Hiatt's \"The Usual\". The film was a critical and commercial flop. Dylan was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in January 1988, with Bruce Springsteen's introduction declaring, \"Bob freed your mind the way Elvis freed your body. He showed us that just because music was innately physical did not mean that it was anti-intellectual.\"The album Down in the Groove in May 1988 sold even more unsuccessfully than his previous studio album. Michael Gray wrote: \"The very title undercuts any idea that inspired work may lie within. Here was a further devaluing of the notion of a new Bob Dylan album as something significant.\" The critical and commercial disappointment of that album was swiftly followed by the success of the Traveling Wilburys. Dylan co-founded the band with George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, Roy Orbison, and Tom Petty, and in late 1988 their multi-platinum Traveling Wilburys Vol. 1 reached three on the US album chart, featuring songs that were described as Dylan's most accessible compositions in years. Despite Orbison's death in December 1988, the remaining four recorded a second album in May 1990 with the title Traveling Wilburys Vol. 3.Dylan finished the decade on a critical high note with Oh Mercy produced by Daniel Lanois.

A U.S. interagency group traveled to Saudi Arabia twice, in 1999 and 2000, to get information from the Saudis about their understanding of those finances. The group eventually concluded that the oft-repeated assertion that  Bin Laden was funding al Qaeda from his personal fortune was in fact not true. The officials developed a new theory: al Qaeda was getting its money elsewhere, and the United States needed to focus on other sources of funding, such as charities, wealthy donors, and financial facilitators. Ultimately, although the intelligence community devoted more resources to the issue and produced somewhat more intelligence, it remained difficult to distinguish al Qaeda's financial transactions among the vast sums moving in the international financial system. The CIA was not able to find or disrupt al Qaeda's money flows. The NSC staff thought that one possible solution to these weaknesses in the intelligence community was to create an all-source terrorist-financing intelligence analysis center. Clarke pushed for the funding of such a center at Treasury, but neither Treasury nor the CIA was willing to commit the resources. Within the United States, various FBI field offices gathered intelligence on organizations suspected of raising funds for al Qaeda or other terrorist groups. By 9/11, FBI agents understood that there were extremist organizations operating within the United States supporting a global jihadist movement and with substantial connections to al Qaeda. The FBI operated a web of informants, conducted electronic surveillance, and had opened significant investigations in a number of field offices, including New York, Chicago, Detroit, San Diego, and Minneapolis. On a national level, however, the FBI never used the information to gain a systematic or strategic understanding of the nature and extent of al Qaeda fundraising. Treasury regulators, as well as U.S. financial institutions, were generally focused on finding and deterring or disrupting the vast flows of U.S. currency generated by drug trafficking and high-level international fraud. Large-scale scandals, such as the use of the Bank of New York by Russian money launderers to move millions of dollars out of Russia, captured the attention of the Department of the Treasury and of Congress. Before 9/11, Treasury did not consider terrorist financing important enough to mention in its national strategy for money laundering. \n\nQuestion: \"What types of activities did the Treasury Department focus on while missing the boat on terrorist funding?\"\n\nResponse: \"Drug trafficing, international fraud and Russian money laundering\"\npick from the following.\n 1). no.\n 2). yes.\nDoes the response correctly answer the question?\n\n", "Detailed Instructions: In this task, you are given a sentence in either Spanish or English.

Democracy is sometimes referred to as \"rule of the majority\". Democracy was originally conceived in Classical Greece, where political representatives were chosen by a jury from amongst the male citizens: rich and poor.  - The history of Islam concerns the political, economic, social, and cultural developments of the Islamic civilization.  - Muhammad (c.\u00a0570 CE  8 June 632 CE) is the central figure of Islam and widely regarded as its founder by non-Muslims. He is known as the \"Holy Prophet\" to Muslims, almost all of whom consider him to be the last prophet sent by God to mankind to restore Islam, believed by Muslims to be the unaltered original monotheistic faith of Adam, Abraham, Moses, Jesus, and other prophets. Muhammad united Arabia into a single Muslim polity and ensured that his teachings, practices, and the Quran, formed the basis of Islamic religious belief.  - The Rashidun\" Caliphs (Rightly Guided Caliphs; '), often simply called, collectively, \"\"'the \"Rashidun\", is a term used in Sunni Islam to refer to the 30-year reign of the first four caliphs (successors) following the death of the Islamic prophet Muhammad, namely: Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman ibn Affan, and Ali of the Rashidun Caliphate, the first caliphate. The concept of \"Rightly Guided Caliphs\" originated with the later Abbasid Caliphate based in Baghdad. It is a reference to the Sunni imperative \"Hold firmly to my example (\"sunnah\") and that of the Rightly Guided Caliphs\" (Ibn Majah, Abu Dawood).  - Hizb ut - Tahrir ( Arabic :    izb at - Tarr ; Party of Liberation ) is a radical , international , pan-Islamic political organisation , which describes its `` ideology as Islam '' , and its aim as the re-establishment of `` the Islamic Khilafah ( Caliphate ) '' or Islamic state . The new caliphate would be ruled by Islamic Shariah law , unify the Muslim community ( Ummah ) , return the caliphate to its `` rightful place as the first state in the world '' , and carry `` the Da'wah ( spread ) of Islam '' to the world . The organization was founded in 1953 as a Sunni Muslim organization in Jerusalem by Taqiuddin al - Nabhani , an Islamic scholar and appeals court judge ( Qadi ) from the Palestinian village of Ijzim . Since then Hizb ut - Tahrir has spread to more than 50 countries and by one estimate has about one million members . Hizb ut - Tahrir is very active in Western countries , particularly in the United Kingdom , and is also active in several Arab and Central Asian countries , despite being banned by some governments . Members typically meet in small private study circles but in countries where the group is not illegal ( such as Europe ) , it also organises rallies and conferences and engages with the media . The party 's doctrine has been described as based on its deceased founder 's writings and `` unchanged in the last 50 years '' , with any changes potentially undermining party unity . It promotes a detailed program and `` draft constitution '' for the caliphate , which would be a unitary ( not federal ) state , and run by a caliph head of state elected by Muslims . Hizb ut - Tahrir states that the re-establishment of caliphate would provide stability and security to both Muslims and non-Muslims in the predominantly Muslim regions of the world . Hizb ut - Tahrir is also strongly anti-Zionist and calls for the State of Israel , which it calls an `` illegal entity '' , to be `` dismantled '' or `` destroyed '' . Hizb ut - Tahrir has been described as `` controversial '' . Some observers believe it is...  - Pan-Islamism is a political movement advocating the unity of Muslims under one Islamic state  often a Caliphate  or an international organization with Islamic principles. As a form of religious nationalism, Pan-Islamism differentiates itself from other pan-nationalistic ideologies, for example Pan-Arabism, by seeing the ummah (Islamic community) as the focus of allegiance and mobilization, excluding ethnicity as primary factors towards unification.  - A Muslim is someone who follows or practises Islam, a monotheistic Abrahamic religion. Muslims consider the Quran (Koran), their holy book, to be the verbatim word of God as revealed to the Islamic prophet and messenger Muhammad. They also follow the teachings and practices of Muhammad (\"sunnah \") as recorded in traditional accounts (\"hadith\"). \"Muslim\" is an Arabic word meaning \"one who submits (to God)\".  - The Quran (; ', literally meaning \"the recitation\"; also romanized Qur'an or Koran\"') is the central religious text of Islam, which Muslims believe to be a revelation from God (\"Allah\"). It is widely regarded as the finest work in classical Arabic literature. The Quran is divided into chapters (\"surah\" in Arabic), which are then divided into verses (\"ayah\").  - A caliphate (\"khilfa\") is an area containing an Islamic steward known as a caliph (\"\" )a person considered a religious successor to the Islamic prophet, Muhammad (Muhammad ibn Abdullh), and a leader of the entire Muslim community. The Rashidun caliphs, who directly succeeded Muhammad as leaders of the Muslim community, were chosen through \"shura, \"a process of community consultation that some consider to be an early form of Islamic democracy. During the history of Islam after the Rashidun period, many Muslim states, almost all of them hereditary monarchies, have claimed to be caliphates.  - Islam (' ;) is a religion articulated by the Quran, a text considered by its adherents to be the verbatim word of God ('), and, for the vast majority of adherents, the teachings and normative example (called the \"sunnah\", composed of accounts called \"hadith\") of Muhammad (5708 June 632 CE). It is the world's second-largest religion and the fastest-growing major religion in the world, with over 1.7 billion followers or 23% of the global population, known as Muslims. Islam is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion that upholds that God is one and incomparable and that the purpose of existence is to worship God. Muslims consider Muhammad to be the last prophet of God.  - A monarch is the sovereign head of state in a monarchy. A monarch may exercise the highest authority and power in the state, or others may wield that power on behalf of the monarch. Typically a monarch either personally inherits the lawful right to exercise the state's sovereign rights (often referred to as \"the throne\" or \"the crown\") or is selected by an established process from a family or cohort eligible to provide the nation's monarch. Alternatively, an individual may become monarch by conquest, acclamation or a combination of means. A monarch usually reigns for life or until abdication.   - An Islamic state (\"\") is a type of government primarily based on the application of shari'a (Islamic law), dispensation of justice, maintenance of law and order. From the early years of Islam, numerous governments have been founded as \"Islamic\".  - In religion, a prophet is an individual who has claimed to have been contacted by the supernatural or the divine, and to speak for them, serving as an intermediary with humanity, delivering this newfound knowledge from the supernatural source to other people. The message that the prophet conveys is called a prophecy, which transports  at least in Judaism  a message beyond mere pagan soothsaying, augury, divination, or forecasting, and, most prominently in the neviim of the Tanakh, often comprises issues of social justice.  - It is a synonym for ' (the Islamic Community), and it is commonly used to mean the collective community of Islamic peoples. In the Quran the ummah typically refers to a single group that shares common religious beliefs, specifically those that are the objects of a divine plan of salvation. In the context of Pan-Islamism and politics, the word ' can be used to mean the concept of a \"Commonwealth of the Believers\" (\"\").  - Commonwealth is a traditional English term for a political community founded for the common good. Historically it has sometimes been synonymous with \"republic\".    Given the paragraphs above, decide what entity has the relation 'political ideology' with 'sunni islam'.\nA:", "As an Enron employee who is a member of the United Way Young Leaders, please join other young leaders throughout Houston for a celebration on October 10.

In taking care of yourself, you will come to care for yourself more and more. To take care of yourself, you\u2019ll need to practice proper hygiene. Wash your hair, and your skin regularly. Brush your teeth and your hair. Use deodorant. Wash your hands when needed. This will help you feel good about your body. If you or your family have a hard time paying for personal hygiene items, there are often many resources in the community where you can get them for free. Local churches and organizations will often have services that provide necessities. If they don\u2019t, they may know where to look for help. Take care of your clothes. Wash them when they\u2019re dirty and fold them to keep them from getting wrinkled. Don\u2019t keep clothes that have a lot of holes or are ripped. Try to remove stains from clothing and if they can\u2019t be removed, get rid of the clothes. Wear clothing that fits, not clothes that are too small or way too baggy. If you have problems getting new clothes, you can get clothing for free from many local churches and community outreach centers. Thrift stores will also have clothing that is much cheaper than what you\u2019d pay in normal stores. If you\u2019re worried that all you can find is outdated clothing, try thrift stores in nice towns or nice parts of town. Stores next to big colleges will be your best bet. This will increase your chances of finding clothes which are practically new and certainly nice enough to wear for many years. Teenage years are formative years, and many teens suffer from a deficit of sleep. You may think it's fine to skimp on sleep, but this practice actually has a serious impact on your health. Scientists have found that poor or little sleep is associated with lower rates of optimism and self-esteem.  So if you want an easy way to boost your self-esteem as a teen, shoot to get at least 7 or 8 hours of sleep every night. A big part of feeling good in your own skin is exercising. Extra fat or generally being out of shape can make you feel sluggish, out of breath, or just unpleasant. Exercise will help you feel more energetic and healthier. Anything which gets your heart rate up for at least ten minutes is exercise. Work out by jogging, doing push-ups and crunches, or doing squats. Anything that works for you is perfectly fine... just be consistent and don\u2019t give up! Eating healthy, like exercising, will lead you to feel better in your own skin. Eating a lot of junk food will weigh you down and make you feel sluggish and sick. Eating healthy food will give you more energy and you\u2019ll feel much happier.

Movie plot: The film opens with a woman walking her dog down an empty, darkened city street. As she passes by a manhole, she is attacked by a creature, and the dog is pulled in after her. George Cooper (John Heard) lives with his girlfriend Lauren (Kim Greist). George, a once-prominent fashion photographer, has since forgone the fame and fortune. His current project is photographing New York City's homeless population, specifically those known as \"undergrounders\", or people who reside within the bowels of the city. A police captain named Bosch (Christopher Curry) is introduced. Bosch has a personal interest in the recent flood of missing persons (most of whom are homeless) being reported to his precinct. Bosch interviews A.J. \"The Reverend\" Shepherd (Daniel Stern), who runs the local homeless shelter. Shepherd believes recent events to be a part of a massive government cover-up and has the evidence to prove it. Bosch's superiors know more than they are letting on and seem to be taking their cues from an overly glib, weasely type named Wilson (George Martin), who works for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. It turns out there are monsters lurking beneath the streets; beings that were once human, but have been mutated by radioactive, chemical toxic waste into hideous, flesh-eating creatures that prey on the homeless who live in the underground. Given the recent drop in the underground transient population, the creatures have resorted to coming to the surface through sewer manholes in order to feed. Through a series of events, both George and A.J. find themselves trapped in the sewers, a reporter gets involved (and eaten), and Lauren has a problem with both a clogged shower drain and an unexpected visitor that comes up through the sewer access point that she unfortunately decides to open in the basement of her apartment building.

He appeared in more than 130 films, and was a leading role actor in the films of Werner Herzog, including \"Aguirre, the Wrath of God\" (1972), \"Nosferatu the Vampyre\" (1979), \"Woyzeck\" (1979), \"Fitzcarraldo\" (1982), and \"Cobra Verde\" (1987). He also appeared in many Spaghetti Westerns, such as \"For a Few Dollars More\" (1965), \"A Bullet for the General\" (1966), \"The Great Silence\" (1968), \"And God Said to Cain\" (1970), \"Shoot the Living and Pray for the Dead\" (1971) and \"A Genius, Two Partners and a Dupe\" (1975). A controversial figure in Germany, some of Kinski's violent outbursts on set were filmed in Herzog's documentary \"My Best Fiend\".  - A composer (Latin \"compn\"; literally \"one who puts together\") is a person who creates or writes music, which can be vocal music (for a singer or choir), instrumental music (e.g., for solo piano, string quartet, wind quintet or orchestra) or music which combines both instruments and voices (e.g., opera or art song, which is a singer accompanied by a pianist). The core meaning of the term refers to individuals who have contributed to the tradition of Western classical music through creation of works expressed in written musical notation (e.g., sheet music scores).  - A Bullet for the General (Es. \"Qui\u00e9n sabe?\"), also known by its international title El Chucho Qui\u00e9n Sabe?, is a 1967 Italian Zapata Western film directed by Damiano Damiani, written by Salvatore Laurani and Franco Solinas, and starring Gian Maria Volont\u00e8, Lou Castel, Klaus Kinski and Martine Beswick. The film tells the story of El Chuncho, a bandit, and Bill Tate (or El Nio), who is a counter-revolutionary in Mexico. Chuncho soon learns that social revolution is more important than mere money. This is one of the more famous Zapata Westerns, a subgenre of the spaghetti western which deals with the radicalizing of bad men and bandits into revolutionaries when they are confronted with injustice. Others in this subgenre include \"Compa\u00f1eros\", \"The Mercenary\" and perhaps most famously \"Duck, You Sucker!\"  - An actor (or actress for females; see terminology) is a person who portrays a character in a performance. The actor performs \"in the flesh\" in the traditional medium of the theatre, or in modern mediums such as film, radio, and television. The analogous Greek term is, literally \"one who answers\".

It means she can remember every small event-which most people would forget with in (......)  days-as if it had happened just minutes ago. \"I remember my mum putting me in the driver's seat of a car and taking a picture of me when I was 12 days old,\" she said. \"That's my earliest memory.

If she's eating something that she doesn't like, she thinks about Black Forest cake, her favorite food, and the memory will be so strong that she can nearly \"taste\" it. However,  sometimes her memories prove   to be painful. Because they're not just events that she remembers. \"When I relive   memories, the feelings return, too,\" Rebecca said. \"For example, I remember falling over when I was three at my grandparents' house and hurting my left knee.

Defined as the oxygen uptake required at a given submaximal running velocity, it has been considered a key aerobic parameter related to endurance running performance. In this context, concurrent strength and endurance training has been considered an effective method, although conclusions on the optimal concurrent training cannot yet be drawn.', 'To evaluate the effect of concurrent training on RE in endurance running athletes and identify the effects of subject characteristics and concurrent training variables on the magnitude of RE improvement.', 'We conducted a computerized search of the PubMed and Web of Science databases, and references of original studies were searched for further relevant studies. The analysis comprised 20 effects in 16 relevant studies published up to August 2015. The outcomes were calculated as the difference in percentage change between control and experimental groups (% change) and data were presented as mean \u00b1 95 % confidence limit. Meta-analyses were performed using a random-effects model and, in addition, simple and multiple meta-regression analyses were used to identify effects of age, training status, number of sessions per week, training duration, type of strength training, and neuromuscular performance on % change in RE.', 'The concurrent training program had a small beneficial effect on RE (% change = -3.93 \u00b1 1.19 %; p < 0.001). In addition, explosive (% change = -4.83 \u00b1 1.53; p < 0.001) and heavy weight (% change = -3.65 \u00b1 2.74; p = 0.009) training programs produced similar improvements in RE, while isometric training (% change = -2.20 \u00b1 4.37; p = 0.324) in selected studies did not induce a significant effect. The multiple linear meta-regression analysis showed that all the differences between % changes could be explained by including the above-mentioned characteristics of subjects and weight training program elements. This model showed that the magnitude of the % change in RE was larger for longer training duration (\u03b2 = -0.83 \u00b1 0.72, p = 0.02).\\Question: Are explosive Training and Heavy Weight Training Effective for Improving Running Economy in Endurance Athletes : A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis?\nOutput:", "Select your answer from the options.

Yet, even through October, Bermuda isn't ready to stop for the winter. During this month, world-class festivals on teh island keep things lively and the weather remains comfortable enough for Bermuda shorts and bathing suits. In October, Bermuda hosts two major festivals--the Bermuda Music Festival and the Bermuda Culinary Arts  Festival. The 10thanniversary Bermuda Music Festival begins October 5 and features three days of performances at the Royal Naval Dockyard on Bermuda's West End. Featured main stage performers include Joss Stone, Pattie Labelle, and Al Green, and a second stage spotlights local Bermudian artists. General admission tickets start at $60 for on e day  or $160 for a three-day pass. Starting October 21, the Culinary Arts Festival brings some of North America's top chefs to the island for four days of food and wine tastings, conferences and cooking competitions. Participating chefs include Todd English and Michael Lomonaco, among others. Three-day festival passes start at $649 per person, but you can also buy separate tickets for individual events. Even if you don't attend one of the festivals, there's still plenty to do. With mostly sunny days and temperatures averaging aroung 79 degrees, the weather is just right for participating in Bermuda's two favorite pastimes--golf and tennis. With fewer visitors on the island than during the summer, you may have an easier time getting the best times or a spot on the courts. It's also still warm enough to enjoy the island's pink sand beaches and go swimming, because the water keeps the summer's heat longer than the air. Of course, you can always shop in the city of Hamilton's upscale  small goods arts and crafts shops.

Context: Hume maintained that all knowledge, even the most basic beliefs about the natural world, cannot be conclusively established by reason. Rather, he maintained, our beliefs are more a result of accumulated habits, developed in response to accumulated sense experiences. Among his many arguments Hume also added another important slant to the debate about scientific method \u2014 that of the problem of induction. Hume argued that it requires inductive reasoning to arrive at the premises for the principle of inductive reasoning, and therefore the justification for inductive reasoning is a circular argument. Among Hume's conclusions regarding the problem of induction is that there is no certainty that the future will resemble the past. Thus, as a simple instance posed by Hume, we cannot know with certainty by inductive reasoning that the sun will continue to rise in the East, but instead come to expect it to do so because it has repeatedly done so in the past.\nThe answer is:", "W: Well, that's important.

Unfortunately, the attainment of such an all-consuming goal has not produced the peace and happiness that was expected. There was a dark side to success. Fairly recently, the question of balance and its impact on mental health and happiness has taken center stage in many circles of psychological research. Dozens of studies have been conducted and published on the subject as companies and individuals alike have noticed that their chaotic lifestyle has not produced the happiness they hoped to achieve. The cost has greatly outweighed the benefits. The majority of these studies agree on one thing \u2013 there is potential for incredible benefits from living a balanced life filled with interesting and varied experiences rather than living with an all-consuming focus on career. The studies also included some important findings about the effects of stress. Stress is not always detrimental to health and happiness. In fact, a bit of stress here and there is actually healthy, for both plants and animals \u2013 it stimulates growth and development. It depends on the source of the stress, how relentles it is, and how it is managed. The danger comes when relentless stress pounds the mind and body and the individuals accept it as the norm. They cope with it the best they can; but allow no time for recovery from the depletion of resources. Professional burnout from chronic stress debilitates the individual to the point that s/he can no longer function effectively on a personal or professional level. Psychology Today tells us that \u201cBurnout is one of those road hazards in life that high-achievers really should be keeping a close eye out for, but sadly \u2013 often because of their \u201cI can do everything\u201d personalities, they rarely see it coming.\u201d According to the above context, answer the following question.

Article: A lot of people are afraid of spiders . One would even avoid walking in grass . And if he thought the spider was in the room or house, he would have to leave the house for days. In fact, fear of spiders is a type of disorder called specific phobia , one of the most common anxiety disorders, which annoys about 7% of the population, a study says. Common specific phobias also include fear of blood, needles, snakes, flying and enclosed spaces. The Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine tried the \"exposure Therapy \", which was small, done on 12 adults, but all of them held or petted the spider afterward. One participant celebrated by getting a spider tattoo  after having been unable to even look at photos of spiders. This is the first study to document the immediate and long-term brain changes after treatment and to illustrate how the brain recognizes long-term to reduce fear as a result of the therapy.  Every one would come in thinking: I am going to be the one who can't do this .

Review title: Very nice with one flaw Product review: I really like the mouse and I'm sorry to see it only available \"used\" now. I found the symmetric side buttons felt more natural than having 2 on one side operated by the thumb. Also, although not applicable to me, the mouse is right/left symmetric so it should be fine for either hand. The wheel doesn't have tilt, which is another plus in my opinion (I find using the click feature on a wheel too vulnerable to right/left movement on the wheel at the same time).The flaw I found is the little button on the top (which I really really like). This button becoming less responsive (or multi-clicking) has been the failure mode for 2 of these I've owned (yes, I like them and they are cheap). I use the button for \"Close window\", which gets more use than \"change program\" or whatever it's supposed to be used for. Maybe I'm over taxing it, but I'd be so happy if that button held up as long as the others (which have never failed).\nAnswer:", "Question: Question: \"Who does the Kumari celebrate?\"  Context: \"Kumari Ghar is a palace in the center of the Kathmandu city, next to the Durbar square where a Royal Kumari selected from several Kumaris resides.

In exchange for this, the protectorate usually accepts specified obligations, which may vary greatly, depending on the real nature of their relationship. Therefore, a protectorate remains an autonomous part of a sovereign state. They are different from colonies as they have local rulers and people ruling over the territory and experience rare cases of immigration of settlers from the country it has suzerainty of. However, a state which remains under the protection of another state but still retains independence is known as a protected state and is different from protectorates.  - Lenyeletse Seretse ( 25 June 1920 -- 3 January 1983 ) was Vice-President of Botswana from 1980 until his death on 3 January 1983 .

During the nine-month-long Bangladesh war for independence, members of the Pakistani military and supporting Islamist militias from Jamaat-e-Islami killed up to 3,000,000 people and raped between 200,000 and 400,000 Bangladeshi women in a systematic campaign of genocidal rape. Some estimates mention the number of people killed between 300,000500,000, and describe the 3 million number as excessively inflated. The actions against women were supported by Imams and Muslim religious leaders, who declared that Bengali women were 'war-booty'.

It states that nations, based on respect for the principle of equal rights and fair equality of opportunity, have the right to freely choose their sovereignty and international political status with no interference. This principle can be traced to the Atlantic Charter, signed on 14 August 1941, by Franklin D. Roosevelt, President of the United States of America, and Winston Churchill, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, who pledged The Eight Principal points of the Charter. It also is derived from principles espoused by United States President Woodrow Wilson following World War I, after which some new nation states were formed, or previous states were revived after the dissolution of empires. The principle does not state how the decision is to be made, nor what the outcome should be, whether it be independence, federation, protection, some form of autonomy or full assimilation. Neither does it state what the delimitation between nations should benor what constitutes a nation. There are conflicting definitions and legal criteria for determining which groups may legitimately claim the right to self-determination.  - The Bangladesh Awami League (Bengali transliteration:   ; translated from Urdu: Bangladesh People's League); AL is one of the two major political parties of Bangladesh.

Ordered by the central government in West Pakistan, this was seen as the sequel to \"Operation Blitz\" which had been launched in November 1970. The original plan envisioned taking control of the major cities on March 26, and then eliminating all opposition, political or military, within one month. President Yahya Khan at a conference in February 1971 said \"Kill three million of them and the rest will eat out of our hands.\" Prolonged Bengali resistance was not anticipated by the Pakistani military leaders. The main phase of Operation Searchlight ended with the fall of the last major town in Bengali hands in mid-May. The operation also precipitated the 1971 Bangladesh genocide and caused roughly 10 million refugees to flee to India as well as the death of up to 3,000,000 civilians. Bengali intelligentsia, academics and Hindus were targeted for the harshest treatment, with significant indiscriminate killing taking place. These systematic killings enraged the Bengalis, who declared independence from Pakistan, to establish the new state of Bangladesh.  - The Prime Minister of the People's Republic of Bangladesh ( ) is the Head of the Government of Bangladesh.

A district hospital typically is the major health care facility in its region, with large numbers of beds for intensive care and additional beds for patients who need long-term care. Specialised hospitals include trauma centres, rehabilitation hospitals, children's hospitals, seniors' (geriatric) hospitals, and hospitals for dealing with specific medical needs such as psychiatric treatment (see psychiatric hospital) and certain disease categories. Specialised hospitals can help reduce health care costs compared to general hospitals.  - Bhutan ('), officially the Kingdom of Bhutan ('), is a landlocked country and the smallest state in Asia to be located entirely within the Himalaya mountain range. Located in the Eastern Himalayas, it is bordered by China in the north and India in the south. Bhutan lacks a border with nearby Nepal due to the Indian state of Sikkim and with Bangladesh due to the Indian states of West Bengal and Assam.

Patsy Douglas comes up with an ingenious way to get a seat on the crowded New York subway: she pretends to have a baby, using a doll discarded by the advertising agency where she works. One day, however, her agency's primary client, short-tempered Cyrus Baxter, happens to be seated beside her. (His chauffeur had abruptly quit after Baxter berated him for getting stuck in a traffic jam.) He is delighted when he overhears that she named her \"child\" Cyrus after him. He becomes acquainted with her, letting her assume that he works for Baxter as a watchman. Later, when the agency's two bosses, Sam Morley and Barry Holmes see Baxter to try to get him to sign a contract for a new advertising campaign, he insists they keep her happy, to their puzzlement. Morley and Holmes discover that she has been fired; they quickly hire her back and promote her from her secretarial duties. Meanwhile, Baxter keeps seeing Patsy, trying to help her with his namesake. She manages to maintain her charade, but Morley sees them together and assumes that she is Baxter's mistress. Patsy discovers her new friend's identity when her bosses send her to present their latest idea. Meanwhile, Baxter's temper improves under Patsy's influence. When Morley and Holmes finally learn the truth, Patsy wants to confess all to Baxter, but they insist she carry on the masquerade until they get his signature on the contract. She reluctantly agrees, after they point out that they will probably have to close if they do not get Baxter's business, throwing hundreds out of work. When Morley shows Baxter a photograph of the baby (actually a picture of his partner as a child), Baxter notices a resemblance to Holmes and assumes he is the father.

The sensor is worn as a bracelet and the data acquired are transferred via a Blue-tooth channel to a smartphone. A dedicated software transforms the signal from a grey to a colour scale. The signal response has been assessed over low (20 to 120 ppb) as well as higher (1-15 ppm range) levels. The sensor has been applied to monitor potential FA fumes of some artwork in two locations: the Tate\u2019s gallery in London, during the display of several pieces of Damien Hirst, as well as in the Summer Palace in Beijing. In the first case, one of Hirst\u2019s main subjects is the setting-up of giant fish tanks filled by thousands of liters of FA, in which intact biological specimens are immersed, such as zebras, cows, calves, even sharks. The parallelepiped-shaped basins are then covered with a lid and fully sealed with silicon gums. It has been found that the tanks are surrounded by FA fumes, constantly exuded in the atmosphere (likely via the sealant), reaching levels of 5 ppm, one order of magnitude higher than the 0.5 ppm limit set up by legislation. In the Summer Palace too posters in display and wooden beam works have been found to release FA vapours. ||||| Damien Hirst knows there's nothing like a touch of mild peril to set the art world alight - and it seems that's exactly what the artist inadvertently produced at his 2012 Tate gallery retrospective. \n  \n A research paper in a Royal Society of Chemistry journal detailed in the Daily Mail, reportedly found that Hirst's preserved artworks \"Away From The Flock\" and \"Mother And Child Divided\", leaked potentially dangerous levels of formaldehyde whilst displayed at Tate Modern gallery for five months in 2012. Atmospheric levels reportedly reached up to 5ppm (parts per million) - ten times over the advisory limit. \n  \n Damien Hirst has, in the past, hinted at his impish lust for using the dangerous chemical in his work, claiming his penchant for formaldehyde is driven by the fact that \"it is dangerous and it burns your skin. If you breathe it in, it chokes you.\" \n  \n A spokesman for the Tate gallery responded to the report: \"Tate always puts the safety of its staff and visitors first, and we take all necessary precautions when installing and displaying our exhibitions.

Her collaborations with the songwriters and record producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis resulted in an unconventional sound: a fusion of rhythm and blues, rap vocals, funk, disco and synthesized percussion that established Jackson, Jam and Lewis as the leading innovators of contemporary R&B. The album became Jackson's commercial breakthrough and enabled her to transition into the popular music market, with Control becoming one of the foremost albums of the 1980s and contemporary music. The album is also notable for being what originated the style and genre that came to be known as new jack swing.Containing autobiographical themes, a majority of the album's lyrics came as the result of a series of changes in her life: a recent annulment of her marriage to singer James DeBarge, severing her business affairs from her father and manager Joseph and the rest of the Jackson family, hiring the A&M executive John McClain as her new management, and her subsequent introduction to Jam and Lewis. The album has been praised by critics as both an artistic feat and as a personal testament of self-actualization. It has also been regarded as a template upon which numerous female artists have modeled their careers, particularly black women.

Jeff narrowly avoids colliding with a beat-up truck. Later, at a gas station, Earl, the truck's driver, confronts Jeff, exchanging hostile words. Shortly after the couple resume their journey, their car breaks down on a vacant road. Leaving Jeff with the Jeep, Amy accepts a ride from a passing big rig trucker to get to a nearby diner and call for help. Jeff eventually discovers that someone has tampered with the Jeep's battery connections. After reconnecting them, he drives to the diner, only to discover that no one has seen Amy. When he sees the trucker on the road and forces him to stop, the trucker claims he has never seen Jeff or Amy. Jeff then hails a passing sheriff named Boyd, but a brief search of the truck yields no sign of Amy. The trucker, Red Barr, is let go and Jeff is instructed by Boyd to see his deputy in the town of Brackett. After speaking with the deputy, Jeff goes back to the diner. Billy, a mentally-impaired mechanic, informs Jeff that Amy left with some men, but refuses to speak with the police, claiming they are involved. Jeff rushes to the location Billy mentioned, but is ambushed on a back road by Earl. He escapes by driving his Jeep into a river, then circles back on foot to watch his attackers salvage the Jeep from the river. He is then discovered and knocked out by Billy.

His brother, Cash, reads of their father's death in a Kansas City newspaper and also heads toward Furnace Creek in search of answers. Using an alias, Cash learns that Capt. Walsh has become a drunkard. A mining boss, Leverett, is impressed by the stranger in town and hires him, not knowing Cash's real name or intent.

Leverett sends one of his henchmen to do away with Walsh, but the confession is found by Cash. Rufe is framed, arrested and tried, but escapes.

Nocturnality is an animal behavior characterized by activity during the night and sleeping during the day. This is a behavioral form of detection avoidance called crypsis used by animals to either avoid predation or to enhance prey hunting. Predation risk has long been recognized as critical in shaping behavioral decisions. For example, this predation risk is of prime importance in determining the time of evening emergence in echolocating bats. Although early access during brighter times permits easier foraging, it also leads to a higher predation risk from bat hawks and bat falcons. This results in an optimum evening emergence time that is a compromise between the conflicting demands.Another nocturnal adaptation can be seen in kangaroo rats. They forage in relatively open habitats, and reduce their activity outside their nest burrows in response to moonlight. During a full moon, they shift their activity towards areas of relatively dense cover to compensate for the extra brightness.  Paragraph: John was studying the species in African Savannah.

It\u2019s quite uncommon, but essentially I can get an excruciating migraine in my arm, leg, etc., on top of getting them in my head/temples. For years my family and I had no idea what was happening, and with no vocabulary to properly explain what was happening, I described it for about fifteen years as \u201cbeeping.\u201d Doctors told us it was anything from growth spurts to a grab for attention, and for a while I gave up trying to figure out what they were. When they got worse and I couldn\u2019t ignore them anymore, I was finally sent to a neurologist, who diagnosed me with ice pick headaches. I let out a sigh of relief that I didn\u2019t even know I was holding in; I felt like I could finally breathe. Years of stress and confusion washed off of me, and I started taking a beta blocker to prevent them. I\u2019ve been on them for a few years now, and it\u2019s changed my life for the better. I used to be terrified of learning to drive, for many reasons, but a large one being that if I got an ice pick headache on the road, I couldn\u2019t guarantee the safety of those around me if I was at the wheel.

Context: The U.S. Congress is one step closer to averting a government shutdown Thursday after the U.S. House easily passed a $1.3 trillion spending plan that would end months of the government operating under short-term spending bills. The measure, approved by a 256-167 vote, now goes to the Senate, which has until midnight Friday to approve it and avert the year\u2019s third government closure. The massive bipartisan bill would keep the government funded until the end of September. Lawmakers had just hours to read the nearly 2,200-page bill released Wednesday night. Under Senate rules, a single senator can delay the vote but not stop it entirely. Senator Rand Paul has objected to the short time given to members to read the lengthy legislation. As of Thursday afternoon, the Senate was waiting to see how the vote would proceed, raising the prospect of another brief government shutdown.  With midterm elections looming in November, the bill likely marks the final time Capitol Hill will consider major legislation this year. The measure would fulfill President Donald Trump\u2019s vow to boost military funding but provides funding for limited parts of his immigration agenda. The bill, which the White House said Trump supports, would give Trump a huge budget increase for the military, including a 2.4 percent pay raise for military personnel. \u201cToday marks the beginning of a new era for the United States military,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement Thursday. \u201cThis legislation fulfills our pledge to rebuild the United States military.\u201d After extensive negotiations between Republicans and Democrats, the bill also provides $1.6 billion for physical barriers and 150 kilometers (93 miles) of a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, short of the $25 billion Trump requested for the project he repeatedly touted on the campaign trail while pledging Mexico would pick up the cost.

Collectively, these churches have over 15 million members. The vast majority of adherents belong to The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church), with their predominant theology being Mormonism. The LDS Church self-identifies as Christian. A minority of Latter Day Saint adherents, such as members of the Community of Christ, believe in traditional Protestant theology, and have distanced themselves from some of the distinctive doctrines of Mormonism. Other groups include the Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, which supports lineal succession of leadership from Smith's descendants, and the more controversial Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, which defends the practice of polygamy.  - Mormonism is the predominant religious tradition of the Latter Day Saint movement of Restorationist Christianity. Joseph Smith founded the movement in Western New York in the 1820s. During the 1830s and 1840s, it distinguished itself from traditional Protestantism. Mormonism represents the non-Protestant faith taught by Smith in the 1840s. After he was killed in 1844, most Mormons followed Brigham Young on his westward journey to the area that became the Utah Territory, calling themselves The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). Other sects include Mormon fundamentalism, which seeks to maintain practices and doctrines such as polygamy, and various other small independent denominations. The second-largest Latter Day Saint denomination, the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, since 2001 called \"Community of Christ\", does not describe itself as \"Mormon\", but instead follows a Trinitarian Christian restorationist theology, and also considers itself Restorationist in terms of Latter Day Saint doctrine.  - The Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints (FLDS Church) is one of the largest Mormon fundamentalist denominations and one of the largest organizations in the United States whose members practice polygamy. The FLDS Church emerged in the early 20th century when its founding members left The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The split occurred largely because of the LDS Church's suspension of the practice of polygamy and its decision to excommunicate its members who would continue the practice.  - The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (the LDS Church or, informally, the Mormon Church) is a Christian restorationist church that is considered by its followers to be the restoration of the original church founded by Jesus Christ. The church is headquartered in Salt Lake City, Utah, and has established congregations and built temples worldwide. According to the church, it has over 74,000 missionaries and a membership of over 15 million. It is ranked by the National Council of Churches as the fourth-largest Christian denomination in the United States. It is the largest denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement founded by Joseph Smith during the period of religious revival known as the Second Great Awakening.  - Community of Christ (known from 1872 to 2001 as the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS)) is an American-based international church with roots in the Latter Day Saint movement. The church reports approximately 250,000 members in 50 nations. The church traces its origins to Joseph Smith's establishment of the Church of Christ on April 6, 1830, with the church formally reorganizing on April 6, 1860, following the death of Smith in 1844.  - The Church of Jesus Christ is a sect of the Latter Day Saint movement that was organized by Forrest Toney in 1980 . Toney was raised as a member of the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints in Spokane , Washington . He later moved to Independence , Missouri and in 1977 claimed that he began receiving visions and revelations from God . In a 1980 vision , he was ordained to the high priesthood and told to preach . The RLDS Church refused to let Toney preach , so he began holding services in the Blue Hills Elementary School in Independence and placed advertisements in a local newspaper . Later that year , Toney and some of his followers organized the Church of Jesus Christ , with Toney as `` Elijah and only High Priest '' of the organization .  - The Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints is a denomination in the Latter Day Saint movement. The president of the church is Frederick Niels Larsen, a direct descendant of Joseph Smith.  - Polygamy (from Late Greek , \"polygamia\", \"state of marriage to many spouses\") involves marriage with more than one spouse. When a man is married to more than one wife at a time, it is called polygyny. When a woman is married to more than one husband at a time, it is called polyandry. If a marriage includes multiple husbands and wives, it can be called a group marriage. In contrast, monogamy is marriage consisting of only two parties. Like \"monogamy\", the term \"polygamy\" is often used in a \"de facto\" sense, applied regardless of whether the relationship is recognized by the state. In sociobiology and zoology, researchers use \"polygamy\" in a broad sense to mean any form of multiple mating.

As the task force was studying the issue, $900,000 was cut from state support for civil equal justice services. That prompted the state's two main legal services providers - Columbia Legal Services and Northwest Justice Project - to cut their staffs, Alexander said. The change would increase the cost of filing a lawsuit in Superior Court to $200. The total fee would be split, with 54 percent going to counties and 46 percent going to the state for a newly created equal justice account. Alexander also requested money for five additional Superior Court judgeships and one additional District Court judgeships, arguing that increased caseloads require more judges.

Article: Smartphone, poor sight Look around and you will see people busy on their smatrphones  . Smartphones do make our lives easier. But have you ever thought about what they mean to your eyes? According to a study, half of the British people own smartphones and they spend an average (  ) of two hours a day using them. There has been a 35% increase in the number of people in the U.K who suffer from short-sightedness   since smartphones were introduced there in 1997. Staring  at smartphones for a long time gives you dry eyes. When looking at something in the distance, your eyes automatically blink   a certain number of times. However, when you look at the things closer to your face, the blink slows down. This reduces the amount of tears and causes discomfort in your eyes. Another bad habit is using smartphone in dark rooms before going to sleep. If you look at a bright screen while your pupils   become larger, too much light goes into your eyes. This can be bad for your eyes and causes a disease called glaucoma  . Maybe it is possible for you to stop using your smartphone, but there are a few things you can do to protect your eyes. * Hold your phone at least 30 centimeters away from your eyes when using it. *Take a break every hour and try the following: look at something at least 5 meters away from you and then focus on your nose.

Answer:\nA:", "Given the question: Given the following context:  Despite the steep decline in Watts's popularity, Hope continued to hold a place in popular culture, and there remained those who considered it a major work. When the Tate Gallery held an exhibition of its Watts holdings in 1954, trade unionist and left-wing M.P. Percy Collick urged \"Labour stalwarts\" to attend the exhibition, supposedly privately recounting that he had recently met a Viennese Jewish woman who during \"the terrors of the Nazi War\" had drawn \"renewed faith and hope\" from her photographic copy. Meanwhile, an influential 1959 sermon by Martin Luther King Jr., now known as Shattered Dreams, took Hope as a symbol of frustrated ambition and the knowledge that few people live to see their wishes fulfilled, arguing that \"shattered dreams are a hallmark of our mortal life\", and against retreating into either apathetic cynicism, a fatalistic belief in God's will or escapist fantasy in response to failure.Myths continued to grow about supposed beliefs in the redemptive powers of Hope, and in the 1970s a rumour began spread that after Israel defeated Egypt in the Six-Day War, the Egyptian government issued copies of it to its troops. There is no evidence this took place, and the story is likely to stem from the fact that in early 1974, shortly after the Yom Kippur War between Israel and Egypt, the image of Hope appeared on Jordanian postage stamps. Likewise, it is regularly claimed that Nelson Mandela kept a print of Hope in his cell on Robben Island, a claim for which there is no evidence.In 1990 Barack Obama, at the time a student at Harvard Law School, attended a sermon at the Trinity United Church of Christ preached by Jeremiah Wright. Taking the Books of Samuel as a starting point, Wright explained that he had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G. Sampson delivered a lecture on it in the late 1980s (Sampson described it as \"a study in contradictions\"), before discussing the image's significance in the modern world.  answer the following question:  What is the first name of the person who had studied Watts's Hope in the 1950s, and had rediscovered the painting when Dr Frederick G.

They feel really good about the parent support, but they realize it's impossible for them to solve this problem. The 22,000-student district discovered the shortage last month. \" It's extraordinary. Nobody would have imagined something happening like this at this level,\" said State Treasurer Mike Coffman. Coffman and district officials last week agreed on a state emergency plan freeing up a $ 9.8 million loan that enabled the payroll  to be met for 2,700 teachers and staff in time for the holidays. District officials also took $ 1.7 million from student -activity accounts of its 38 schools. At Coffman's request, the District Attorney has begun investigating the district's finances. Coffman says he wants to know whether district officials hid the budget shortage until after the November election, when voters approved a $ 212 million bond issue for schools.

And the meltdown at Synchronoss--the company that's done a great business hooking all those iPhones up with carrier AT&T (nyse: T - news - people ) since the iPhone was launched last year--is just the latest example.\n\nShares of Synchronoss (nasdaq: SNCR - news - people ) fell $10, or 43.67%, to $12.88 on Wednesday after the Bridgewater, N.J.-based software company slashed its sales and earnings forecasts and reported disappointing first-quarter financial results. It's been a long way down from the stock's high of $44.99 in October.\n\nThe weird part: Synchronoss makes the software that synchs newly purchased iPhones to AT&T's wireless network, and the iPhone is doing just fine.\n\nYet in a statement, Synchronoss Chief Executive Steven Waldis blamed the iPhone for his troubles.\n\nSo what's the problem? In a note to investors Wednesday, Thomas Weisel Partners analyst Tom Roderick pointed to several possibilities as he downgraded the company to \"market weight\" from \"overweight.\"\n\nThe most obvious: More customers than previously believed are unlocking the iPhone and using it on other networks.\n\nRoderick pointed to a pair of other intriguing possibilities as well: Apple (nasdaq: AAPL - news - people ) could scale back its business with Synchronoss as it launches the second-generation model of the iPhone this year. Or, Apple may be about to broaden the array of carriers it works with in the United States, reducing the value of Synchronoss' ability to shuttle data to AT&T's network.\n\nAnother possibility: Apple could be moving to a different authentication scheme for its next-generation iPhone, according to Roger Kay, president of Endpoint Technologies Associates. Maybe Apple will begin selling unlocked iPhones.\n\n\"In the absence of any good information, you have to speculate,\" Kay says.\n\nApple's secretiveness is only compounding the problem for Synchronoss. \"We find ourselves failing to fully grasp the altered dynamics of the company's iPhone relationship,\" Weisel's Roderick wrote. Other analysts, citing a lack of \"transparency\" echoed Roderick's sentiments.\n\nApple no doubt, has Synchronous locked up tight with nondisclosure agreements. The Cupertino, Calif.-based company has long been a difficult customer.\n\nIn 2005, Apple shocked its fans by switching from using PowerPC microprocessors from IBM (nyse: IBM - news - people ) and Freescale to chips from Intel (nasdaq: INTC - news - people ). The next year, Apple dropped technology from PortalPlayer--the company that developed early versions of the iPod--from its lineup of digital music players.\n\nOdds are, Synchronoss will be OK. While more 72% of its sales are now AT&T-related, the company is promising that deals with Time Warner (nyse: TWX - news - people ) and Vodafone (nyse: VOD - news - people ) will reduce the company's dependence on Apple.\n\nOf course, just a few months ago, it was Apple that seemed dependent on Synchronoss.

On its way back to base the convoy that has delivered the supplies is ambushed by another faction of the mujahedin. The paratroopers take cover and fight back with only a few casualties, but the road is blocked by a damaged fuel tanker. While Bandura personally drives a tank to push the tanker off the road, inexperienced Steklov dashes forward attempting to lead troops to counterattack and is badly wounded. Later, his leg is amputated at the hospital, which adds to the stack of Bandura's career problems. Bandura decides to stay with his men for a while and lead a retaliatory mission to finish a mujahedin leader, who is presumed wounded and taken to the neutral warlord's village. When the preparations are finished, Bandura comes to say good bye to Katya, who is scheduled to leave the country...\nAnswer:", " #39;Toba outlook for GDP down\n\nIt sounds worse than it is.

To more than tease the standards of stardom, however, Bledsoe and Morris will be required to post those eye-popping numbers much more often.\n\nWell, the Suns' two best players produced all but three of their Phoenix's points in each of the first two quarters Saturday. Unfortunately, it was in the process of mustering a franchise record for offensive futility in a half.\n\n\"The bright side,\" Suns coach Jeff Hornacek said after the eventual 101-74 loss, \"was that they all played bad the same night. Everyone got their bad game out the same night.\"\n\nBy the way, that 24-minute, 24-point opening half was one less point than the Suns managed against the Sacramento Kings during a half of alleged basketball back in 2001.\n\nMarcus Morris erupted for 15 points in a 31-point fourth quarter -- to kept the Suns from establishing another franchise worst -- and finished with a team-high 19.\n\n\"We came out real flat,\" Marcus Morris said. \"It ain't nothing more, nothing less. ... We came out flat. You can't do that against a team like that. We were flat, the fans were flat ... a bad recipe.\"\n\nTwin brother Markieff, who put up 29 points and 11 rebounds on Oklahoma City, managed 10 and two in 17:56 against the Spurs. Bledsoe finished with a dozen points, six rebounds and no assists. But he and Markieff were a lot more dialed in than the rest of the roster.\n\nBrandon Knight managed one point in 16:42 in the first half but left for the evening after falling on an already-sore hip.\n\n\"They said I should be fine,\" Knight said. \"So, just take it day by day, get treatment and hopefully get better.\"\n\nHis absence didn't really matter. In terms of energy and passion, the Suns' collective went from off the charts to rock bottom in a bit less than 48 hours.\n\n\"I don't know if it was a sense of that,\" Hornacek said, \"just when we brought it in to go out onto the court, it wasn't as enthusiastic as it was before the Oklahoma City game. You never know how to take that, sometimes that's meaningless.\n\n\"After the fact, you can look back and say, oh, maybe that was a clue. I just don't think we were mentally sharp. They (Spurs) got after it. They got after it right from the beginning and made things tough, then all of a sudden we weren't even getting in plays.\"\n\nBased on these disparate levels of motivation, the Suns were in a 51-24 canyon at intermission, with Bledsoe and Markieff (nine points each) joining only three of their teammates in the scoring column. Four of the 12 Phoenix players who participated (those two, Marcus Morris and T.J. Warren) managed a field goal in the opening half. The other eight Suns were 0 for 24 from the field.\n\nPerhaps the most impressive achievement by the Spurs was their refusal to quit defending in the third period. Working for the second night in a row (and this was the final game of their nine-game, Rodeo Road Trip), they remained salty enough to limit the Suns to 17 points in the third quarter.\n\n*By clicking \"SUBSCRIBE\", you have read and agreed to the Fox Sports Privacy Policy and Terms of Use.\n\nIn addition to Marcus Morris providing enough offensive gusto to shoot Phoenix past the franchise's all-time low for points in a game (68 in 1981), some of the young Suns were able to see the floor.\n\nThe rookie Warren scored nine points, while Archie Goodwin and Reggie Bullock received double-digit minutes.\n\n\"You don't want to see them in there when you're getting blown out,\" Hornacek said of the kids, \"but any time we can see them get some action, it's good.\"\n\nInstead of scratching to within a half game of the eighth-seeded Thunder, the Suns (31-29) are 1-1/2 back heading into a four-game road trip that opens Monday in Miami against Goran Dragic and the Heat.\n\n\"Just flush it down the toilet,\" Hornacek said of Saturday's event, \"and move on to the next one.\"\n\nFollow Randy Hill on Twitter\nWhat are the most important parts of this news article?", "Friendships and group involvements could be tricky right now, and you may need to exercise plenty of realism and discrimination about any ideological or political group or cause with which you become associated.\n\nPlease remove spaces between words.", "\nQ: Jesse rode a roller coaster fearfully after his friends pressured him to try it.

Columbia University paleontologist Kate Lloyd (Mary Elizabeth Winstead) is recruited by Dr. Sander Halvorson (Ulrich Thomsen) and his assistant Adam Finch (Eric Christian Olsen) to investigate the discovery. They travel to the Norwegian base, Thule Station, located in Antarctica near U.S. Outpost 31, in a helicopter manned by Carter (Joel Edgerton), Derek (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje), and Griggs (Paul Braunstein). After viewing the spacecraft, Kate, Sander, and Adam are told the group also discovered an alien body from the crash, buried in the ice nearby. In the afternoon the body is brought to the base in a block of ice. That evening, while the team celebrates their find, Derek sees the alien burst from the ice and escape the building. The team searches for the creature and discovers that it killed Lars' dog. Olav and Henrik find the alien, which then grabs and engulfs Henrik. The rest of the group arrive and set fire to the creature, killing it. An autopsy of the scorched alien corpse reveals that its cells were consuming and imitating Henrik's own. Derek, Carter, Griggs and a sick Olav take the helicopter to seek help. Kate discovers bloody dental fillings near a blood-soaked shower. She runs outside to flag down the helicopter after it takes off. When it attempts to land, Griggs transforms into the Thing and attacks Olav, causing the helicopter to spin out of control and crash in the mountains.

They just bought a house. We were considering buying a term life insurance policy for him to protect our own finances from having to help our daughter (and grandson) make house payments if needed. Should we do this or is there another way? \u2014 J. Ryan from California\n\nA: For your daughter and son-in-law, owning life insurance would indeed be a prudent move. But before you go out and buy a policy for them, speak with the pair about their insurance needs and current coverage.\n\nYour son-in-law may already have group life benefits through his employer, which would reduce the amount of term life insurance the couple needs. And if he were to die, your daughter and grandchild might be eligible for Social Security survivor benefits.\n\nIdeally, your son-in-law would be the one to purchase the life insurance policy, but if he is unwilling or unable to afford payments, then it can make sense for you to step in.\n\nThink carefully about your approach, however: Owning a policy where you\u2019re the purchaser and the insured and beneficiary are two other individuals can create big tax headaches. \u201cIn life insurance, any time you have three different people involved, it is bad,\u201d says Jim Swink, vice president of the Raymond James Insurance Group.\n\nMost life insurance proceeds are delivered tax free. But if you own the policy, name your son-in-law as the insured and list your daughter as the beneficiary, then the death benefit becomes a taxable gift to the beneficiary.\n\nAlternatively, you could own the policy on your son-in-law\u2019s life and name yourself as the beneficiary. But then you would still have to gift the benefit money to your daughter, and doing so would likely create a taxable gift, says Chapel Hill, N.C., financial planner Ben Birken.\n\nThe best and simplest route: Have your son-in-law or daughter own the policy and your daughter be the beneficiary, and then gift them the amount needed to cover the premiums. Or if you\u2019re worried about any spendthrift behavior, pay the insurance company directly for the policy, says Swink.\n\nEither way, the money will still be seen as a gift by the IRS, but the cost of annual term life insurance premiums on a relatively young, healthy male should be well below the annual gift tax limit \u2014 $14,000 a year for an individual giver, or $28,000 for a married couple.

Wars of Edward III.--By the Salic law, as the lawyers called it, the crown was given, on the death of Charles IV., to _Philip, Count of Valois_, son to a brother of Philip IV., but it was claimed by Edward III. of England as son of the daughter of Philip IV. Edward contented himself, however, with the mere assertion of his pretensions, until Philip exasperated him by attacks on the borders of Guienne, which the French kings had long been coveting to complete their possession of the south, and by demanding the surrender of Robert of Artois, who, being disappointed in his claim to the county of Artois by the judgment of the Parliament of Paris, was practising by sorcery on the life of the King of France. Edward then declared war, and his supposed right caused a century of warfare between France and England, in which the broken, down-trodden state of the French peasantry gave England an immense advantage. The knights and squires were fairly matched; but while the English yeomen were strong, staunch, and trustworthy, the French were useless, and only made a defeat worse by plundering the fallen on each side alike. The war began in Flanders, where Philip took the part of the count, whose tyrannies had caused his expulsion. Edward was called in to the aid of the citizens of Ghent by their leader Jacob van Arteveldt; and gained a great victory over the French fleet at Sluys, but with no important result. At the same time the two kings took opposite sides in the war of the succession in Brittany, each defending the claim most inconsistent with his own pretensions to the French crown--Edward upholding the male heir, John de Montfort, and Philip the direct female representative, the wife of Charles de Blois. \n\nWhat are the answers to this following set of questions:\n\n1.

India's coastline measures 7,517 kilometres (4,700 mi) in length; of this distance, 5,423 kilometres (3,400 mi) belong to peninsular India and 2,094 kilometres (1,300 mi) to the Andaman, Nicobar, and Lakshadweep island chains. According to the Indian naval hydrographic charts, the mainland coastline consists of the following: 43% sandy beaches; 11% rocky shores, including cliffs; and 46% mudflats or marshy shores.Major Himalayan-origin rivers that substantially flow through India include the Ganges and the Brahmaputra, both of which drain into the Bay of Bengal. Important tributaries of the Ganges include the Yamuna and the Kosi; the latter's extremely low gradient often leads to severe floods and course changes. Major peninsular rivers, whose steeper gradients prevent their waters from flooding, include the Godavari, the Mahanadi, the Kaveri, and the Krishna, which also drain into the Bay of Bengal; and the Narmada and the Tapti, which drain into the Arabian Sea. Coastal features include the marshy Rann of Kutch of western India and the alluvial Sundarbans delta of eastern India; the latter is shared with Bangladesh. India has two archipelagos: the Lakshadweep, coral atolls off India's south-western coast; and the Andaman and Nicobar Islands, a volcanic chain in the Andaman Sea.The Indian climate is strongly influenced by the Himalayas and the Thar Desert, both of which drive the economically and culturally pivotal summer and winter monsoons. The Himalayas prevent cold Central Asian katabatic winds from blowing in, keeping the bulk of the Indian subcontinent warmer than most locations at similar latitudes. The Thar Desert plays a crucial role in attracting the moisture-laden south-west summer monsoon winds that, between June and October, provide the majority of India's rainfall.

His reign of 72 years and 110 days is the longest of any monarch of a major country in European history. In this age of absolutism in Europe, Louis XIV's France was a leader in the growing centralization of power.  - The House of Bourbon is a European royal house of French origin, a branch of the Capetian dynasty. Bourbon kings first ruled France and Navarre in the 16th century. By the 18th century, members of the Bourbon dynasty also held thrones in Spain, Naples, Sicily, and Parma. Spain and Luxembourg currently have Bourbon monarchs.  - The Menus-Plaisirs du Roi was, in the organisation of the French royal household under the Ancien R\u00e9gime, the department of the Maison du Roi responsible for the \"lesser pleasures of the King\", which meant in practice that it was in charge of all the preparations for ceremonies, events and festivities, down to the last detail of design and order.  - Jean Berain the Elder (Saint-Mihiel, Meuse, 1640  24 January 1711, Paris) was a draughtsman and designer, painter and engraver of ornament, the artistic force in the Royal office of the Menus-Plaisirs du Roi where all the designs originated for court spectacle, from f\u00eates to funerals, and many designs for furnishings not covered by the B\u00e2timents du Roi. The \"Berainesque\" style of light arabesques and playful grotesques was an essential element in the \"style R\u00e9gence\" that led to the French rococo.  - Rococo (or ), less commonly roccoco, or \"Late Baroque\", is an early to late French 18th-century artistic movement and style, affecting many aspects of the arts including painting, sculpture, architecture, interior design, decoration, literature, music, and theatre. It developed in the early 18th century in Paris, France as a reaction against the grandeur, symmetry, and strict regulations of the previous Baroque style, especially of the Palace of Versailles, until it was redone. Rococo artists and architects used a more jocular, florid, and graceful approach to the Baroque. Their style was ornate and used light colours, asymmetrical designs, curves, and gold. Unlike the political Baroque, the Rococo had playful and witty themes. The interior decoration of Rococo rooms was designed as a total work of art with elegant and ornate furniture, small sculptures, ornamental mirrors, and tapestry complementing architecture, reliefs, and wall paintings.  - Henri ( de ) Gissey ( ca 1621 -- 1673 ) was a French draughtsman and designer who held the post of dessinateur de la Chambre et du cabinet de Roi in the Menus Plaisirs du Roi in the early years of Louis XIV of France . Jean B\u00e9rain the Elder , who succeeded him in the post , is likely to have been in some sense his pupil . Gissey 's appointment made him responsible for the expressions of court style , above all in the elaborately costumed and produced ballets de cour , in which the young king danced among his courtiers ; following Colbert 's remodelling of the royal household , the Cabinet du Roi , to which Gissey was also attached , produced the sumptuous engraved festival books that often followed such events and are sometimes the only surviving record of them . His court position demanded in addition to designs for costumes , designs for other kinds of court ceremonial festivities , carried out under the general direction of Louis Trelons - Cochon Hesselin , `` Overseer of the King 's pleasures '' , the part of the royal household -- the Maison du Roi -- in charge of entertainments . Hesselin was a grand collector , patron and amateur of art ; for Hesselin 's own lavish entertainments for the king , Gissey 's office produced the costumes and sets .

In art, performance, and literature, however, \"grotesque\" may also refer to something that simultaneously invokes in an audience a feeling of uncomfortable bizarreness as well as sympathetic pity.

In another part of the Arabic city, a mysterious traveler by the name of Haseem seeks the advice and guidance of the city's medicine woman, Fatima. She tells him that the man he is looking for, the one who will help him obtain the treasure he seeks, is a humble young boy by the name of Aladdin. Haseem goes in search of the boy and finds him returning home to his mother bringing her cabbages and watches as he alone defeats three boys that had come to bother and humiliate him. Haseem congratulates Aladdin for his victory, telling him that he fights just as good as his father; for he had known him, Haseem said, for he was his brother and therefore, Aladdin's uncle. That night, the stranger Haseem is welcomed at Aladdin's home by his mother and together, the three of them enjoy a big feast given to them by their new relative. Haseem promises that from now on, neither Aladdin nor his mother shall be hungry ever again and both are delighted. The next morning, Aladdin and his uncle walk a long way to a place where Haseem said he and his brother had played when they were young. Haseem spots the right place when he finds three palm trees that grow as one and a camel made of stone. Then, to Aladdin's surprise, Haseem begins to make magic that makes the very earth shake.

Context: It\u2019s October, which means it\u2019s that time of the year again: flu vaccination time! Back when I worked in a primary care clinic, this is when we made a big push to offer the seasonal flu shot to all of our patients. (And we got ourselves immunized, as well.) Not all of our patients agreed. Many older adults are skeptical of the need to get a yearly vaccination against influenza. They aren\u2019t sure it will help. Or they think that the vaccination will actually give them a mild case of the flu. Or they just don\u2019t like needles. Or maybe they aren\u2019t sure which type of seasonal flu shot to get: the regular one or one of the newer \u201cstronger\u201d versions, designed for older adults? I\u2019m never surprised when people bring up these questions. Vaccination for seasonal influenza can indeed be a confusing topic. But it\u2019s certainly important to consider. Depending on the year, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) estimates that every year, influenza affects 9-60 million Americans, causes 140,000-710,100 hospitalizations, and results in 12,000-56,000 deaths. (Influenza is more severe in some years than others.) Most people get better without needing hospitalization, but some people get very sick. Older adults are especially likely to get dangerously ill from catching the flu. So I agree with the CDC\u2019s recommendation: everyone over the age of 6 months should get their seasonal flu shot. In fact, I\u2019m about to go get mine. As a healthy woman in her 40s, I\u2019m not that concerned about getting dangerously ill from influenza. Instead, I get my annual flu shot because I want to minimize my chance of getting sick and perhaps exposing my older patients to influenza. This month, you\u2019ll probably be encouraged to get vaccinated too. So in this article, I\u2019ll address some key things to know about influenza and the flu shot, along with some common questions and concerns.

V2 underwent a trial modification. It was fitted with an extended nose section with extensive glazing (like the Heinkel He 111 H-6), defensive armament (a 7.92\u00a0mm/.312\u00a0in MG 15 machine gun in the nose, twin-beam positions, a ventral cupola, and a powered dorsal turret), a compartment for ordnance in the fuselage, and navigation and military radio equipment. The company had by now been renamed as the Blohm & Voss aircraft division so the converted aircraft was redesignated the BV 142 V2/U1 while the V1 was similarly converted. Both were used operationally from late 1940 and were posted to the Luftwaffes second surveillance Group. This unit was assigned to the operations staff of Luftflotte III in France. However, their performance was disappointing, and after only a few missions they were withdrawn from service in 1942. Aircraft V3 and V4 were used as transport aircraft for the occupation of Denmark and in the Norway campaign with the KGr.z.b.V. 105 (Special combat team) and could transport 30 fully equipped soldiers over 4,000\u00a0km (2,490\u00a0mi). The ultimate fate of V3 and V4 is unknown. It was later planned to use the V1 and V2 to carry the Henschel GT 1200C guided torpedo, but the plan was cancelled.\n Link Information: none Question: What was the former name of the Blohmn & Voss aircraft division?\nSolution:", "Extract the answer to the following question from the movie plot.

(March 2016) (Learn how and when to remove this template message) Chickens are being prepared for a meal. A chicken escapes, and an armed gang chases after it in a favela called the Cidade de Deus (\"City of God\"). The chicken stops between the gang and a young man named Rocket (Buscap\u00c3\u00a9), who believes the gang wants to kill him. A flashback traces Rocket, the narrator, back to the late 1960s. In the 1960s, the favela is a newly built housing project far from the centre of Rio de Janeiro, with little access to electricity and water. Three impoverished, amateur thieves known as the \"Tender Trio\" \u00e2\u0080\u0093 Shaggy, Clipper, and Goose \u00e2\u0080\u0093 rob and loot business owners; Goose is Rocket's brother. The thieves split part of the loot with the citizens of the City and are protected by them in return. Several younger boys idolize the trio, and one, Li'l Dice (Dadinho), convinces them to hold up a motel and rob its occupants. The gang resolves not to kill anyone and tells Li'l Dice to serve as lookout. They give him a gun and tell him to fire a warning shot if the police arrive, but an unsatisfied Li'l Dice fires a warning shot mid-robbery and guns down the motel inhabitants once the gang have run off. The massacre brings police attention, forcing the trio to split up: Clipper joins the church, Shaggy is shot by the police while trying to escape the favela, and Goose is shot by Li'l Dice after taking the thieving boy's money while Li'l Dice's friend Benny (Ben\u00c3\u00a9) watches. Some years later in the 1970s, the favela has transformed into an urban jungle. Rocket has joined a group of young hippies. He enjoys photography and likes one girl, Angelica, but his attempts to get close to her are ruined by a gang of petty criminal kids known as \"The Runts\".

Answer the above question based on the context below:  There was considerable local opposition to the Yellowstone National Park during its early years. Some of the locals feared that the regional economy would be unable to thrive if there remained strict federal prohibitions against resource development or settlement within park boundaries and local entrepreneurs advocated reducing the size of the park so that mining, hunting, and logging activities could be developed. To this end, numerous bills were introduced into Congress by Montana representatives who sought to remove the federal land-use restrictions.After the park's official formation, Nathaniel Langford was appointed as the park's first superintendent in 1872 by Secretary of Interior Columbus Delano, the first overseer and controller of the park. Langford served for five years but was denied a salary, funding, and staff. Langford lacked the means to improve the land or properly protect the park, and without formal policy or regulations, he had few legal methods to enforce such protection.   This left Yellowstone vulnerable to poachers, vandals, and others seeking to raid its resources. He addressed the practical problems park administrators faced in the 1872 Report to the Secretary of the Interior and correctly predicted that Yellowstone would become a major international attraction deserving the continuing stewardship of the government. In 1874, both Langford and Delano advocated the creation of a federal agency to protect the vast park, but Congress refused. In 1875, Colonel William Ludlow, who had previously explored areas of Montana under the command of George Armstrong Custer, was assigned to organize and lead an expedition to Montana and the newly established Yellowstone Park. Observations about the lawlessness and exploitation of park resources were included in Ludlow's Report of a Reconnaissance to the Yellowstone National Park. The report included letters and attachments by other expedition members, including naturalist and mineralogist George Bird Grinnell. Grinnell documented the poaching of...\nAnswer:", "Fact: oil is a source of gasoline\nQuestion: Gasoline is unable to exist without the addition of raw materials such as\n\nWhat's the answer?

Howard, who plays center, had an outstanding high school career at Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy. He chose to forgo college and entered the 2004 NBA draft, and was selected first overall by the Orlando Magic. An eight-time All-Star, eight-time All-NBA team selection, five-time All-Defensive member, and three-time Defensive Player of the Year, Howard has been ranked consistently as one of the best in the league in rebounds, blocks, field goal percentage and free throw attempts, and has set numerous franchise and league records. He led the Magic to three division titles and one conference title, and he was the winner of the 2008 NBA Slam Dunk Contest. In the 2008 Olympics, he was the starting center for Team USA, which went on to win the gold medal. He was traded to the Los Angeles Lakers in 2012, and signed with the Rockets in 2013.  - The NBA Finals is the championship series of the National Basketball Association (NBA) played between the Western and Eastern champions of the Conference Finals. The first team to win four games in the best-of-seven game series is declared the league champion and is awarded the Larry O'Brien Championship Trophy. Winners from 1946 to 1983 received the Walter A. Brown Trophy redesigned in 1977 to the current form. The NBA Finals has been played at the end of every NBA and Basketball Association of America season in history, the first being held in 1947.  - Vincent Lamar \"Vince\" Carter (born January 26, 1977) is an American professional basketball player for the Memphis Grizzlies of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He is tall and plays both shooting guard and small forward.  - The Orlando Magic is an American professional basketball team based in Orlando, Florida. The Magic compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member club of the league's Eastern Conference Southeast Division. The franchise was established in 1989 as an expansion franchise, and such notable NBA stars as Shaquille O'Neal, Penny Hardaway, Patrick Ewing, Grant Hill, Tracy McGrady, Steve Francis, Dwight Howard, Vince Carter, and Rashard Lewis have played for the club throughout its young history. The franchise has also played in the NBA playoffs for more than half of its existence (14 playoff appearances in 27 years), and twice went to the NBA Finals, in 1995 and 2009. Orlando has been the second most successful of the four expansion teams brought into the league in 1988 and 1989 in terms of winning percentage, after fellow Floridian team Miami Heat.  - Anfernee Deon \"Penny\" Hardaway (born July 18, 1971) is an American retired professional basketball player who played in the National Basketball Association (NBA), specializing as an unconventionally tall point guard. Hardaway's most productive years came in his days as a member of the Orlando Magic as well as the early portion of his stint with the Phoenix Suns. Hardaway often was compared to Magic Johnson during his tenure because both had incredible size and quickness at the point guard position.

If not, let me know by writing \"Not answerable\".  Plot title: The Patriot Movie plot: During the American Revolution in 1776, Benjamin Martin, a veteran of the French and Indian War and a widower with seven children, is called to Charleston to vote in the South Carolina General Assembly on a levy supporting the Continental Army. Fearing war against Great Britain, Benjamin abstains; the vote is nonetheless passed and, against his father's wishes, Benjamin's eldest son Gabriel joins the Continental Army. Four years later Charleston falls to the British and a wounded Gabriel returns home carrying dispatches. The Martins care for both British and American wounded from a nearby battle, before British Dragoons, led by the ruthless Colonel William Tavington, arrive, arrest Gabriel, and take captive the African American free men and women who work Benjamin's land. When Benjamin's second son Thomas tries to free Gabriel, he is shot and killed by Tavington, who then orders the Martins' house burned, and wounded Americans executed. After the British leave, Benjamin gives his next two eldest sons muskets, and they ambush the British unit escorting a tied Gabriel. Benjamin skillfully, yet brutally, kills many soldiers with his tomahawk. A British survivor tells Tavington of the attack, earning Benjamin the moniker of the \"Ghost\". Benjamin and Gabriel resolve to fight the British, leaving the younger children in the care of Benjamin's sister-in-law, Charlotte. On their way to the Continental Army's camp, they witness the southern Continental Army under General Horatio Gates engaging the British Army.

My question: What does Benjamin use to kill many soldiers ?\nAnswer:", "Q:Information:  - A tunnel is an underground passageway, dug through the surrounding soil/earth/rock and enclosed except for entrance and exit, commonly at each end. A pipeline is not a tunnel, though some recent tunnels have used immersed tube construction techniques rather than traditional tunnel boring methods.  - A glacier (or ) is a persistent body of dense ice that is constantly moving under its own weight; it forms where the accumulation of snow exceeds its ablation (melting and sublimation) over many years, often centuries. Glaciers slowly deform and flow due to stresses induced by their weight, creating crevasses, seracs, and other distinguishing features. They also abrade rock and debris from their substrate to create landforms such as cirques and moraines. Glaciers form only on land and are distinct from the much thinner sea ice and lake ice that form on the surface of bodies of water.  - Ladakh (\"land of high passes\") (Ladakhi:  \"la'dwags\"; ) is a region in Indian state of Jammu and Kashmir that currently extends from the Kunlun mountain range to the main Great Himalayas to the south, inhabited by people of Indo-Aryan and Tibetan descent. It is one of the most sparsely populated regions in Jammu and Kashmir and its culture and history are closely related to that of Tibet.  - A drainage basin or catchment basin is an extent or an area of land where all surface water from rain, melting snow, or ice converges to a single point at a lower elevation, usually the exit of the basin, where the waters join another body of water, such as a river, lake, reservoir, estuary, wetland, sea, or ocean. Thus if a tributary stream joins a brook that in turn joins a small river which is a tributary of a larger river, there is a series of successively larger (and lower elevation) drainage basins. For instance, the Missouri and Ohio rivers are within their own drainage basins and also within the drainage basin of the Mississippi River.  - A stream is a body of water with a current, confined within a bed and banks. Depending on its location or certain characteristics, a stream may be referred to as a \"bayou\", \"beck\", \"branch\", \"brook\", \"burn\", \"creek\", \"crick\", \"ghyll\", \"gill\", \"kill\", \"lick\", \"mill race\", \"race\", \"rill\", \"river\", \"rivulet\", \"run\", \"runnel\", \"streamage\", \"syke\", or \"wash\".  - The Tibet Autonomous Region (TAR) or Xizang Autonomous Region, called Tibet or Xizang for short, is a province-level autonomous region of the People's Republic of China (PRC).

Its tens of thousands of glaciers and other geographical and ecological features serve as a \"water tower\" storing water and maintaining flow. The impact of global warming on the Tibetan Plateau is of intense scientific interest.  - Global warming and climate change are terms for the observed century-scale rise in the average temperature of the Earth's climate system and its related effects. Multiple lines of scientific evidence show that the climate system is warming. Although the increase of near-surface atmospheric temperature is the measure of global warming often reported in the popular press, most of the additional energy stored in the climate system since 1970 has gone into the oceans. The rest has melted ice and warmed the continents and atmosphere. Many of the observed changes since the 1950s are unprecedented over tens to thousands of years.  - Xining (\"Xn\u00edng\" ; \"Ziling\"; \"Seleng\") is the capital of Qinghai province in western China, and the largest city on the Tibetan Plateau.
