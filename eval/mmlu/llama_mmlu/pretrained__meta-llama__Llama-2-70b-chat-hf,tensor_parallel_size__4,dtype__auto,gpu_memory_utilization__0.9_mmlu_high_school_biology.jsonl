One can only conclude that it was manufactured improperly.\nD. Although DDT is effective against a wide range of insects, it is not effective against mosquitoes.\nAnswer:",

        "The following are multiple choice questions (with answers) about high school biology.\n\nBefore the human genome was sequenced by the Human Genome Project, scientists expected that they would find about 100,000 genes. In fact, they discovered that humans have only about 24,000 genes. How can we exhibit so many different traits from so few genes?\nA. Modification of histone proteins usually increases the function of genes.\nB. Epigenetics enables one gene to produce many different traits.\nC. This is proof that pseudogenes and introns are expressed.\nD. A single gene can produce more than one trait because of alternative splicing\nAnswer:",

An eager AP Biology student interested in studying osmosis and the movement of water in solutions took a dialysis bag containing a 0.5 M solution and placed it into a beaker containing a 0.6 M solution. It drives the movement of water from a region of lower water potential to a region of higher water potential.\nB. Solute potential is the only factor that determines the water potential.\nC. Pressure potential combines with solute potential to determine the water potential.\nD. Water potential always drives water from an area of lower pressure potential to an area of higher pressure potential.\nAnswer:",
